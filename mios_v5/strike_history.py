"""📊 Per-strike OI / ΔOI history for ATM±2 — accumulated, not fetched.

## Why this had to be built rather than wired

The reference code reads `st.session_state.oi_history` / `.chgoi_history` /
`.oi_current_strikes`. **None of those exist in this repo** — they belong to a
different app. What this repo has is `option_data['df_summary']`, rebuilt every
cycle with `Strike`, the two open-interest columns, the two change-in-OI columns
and the two LTPs — under the names listed in `FIELDS`, which is the only place
those spellings are written down. A time series has to be accumulated from those
snapshots.

Same shape as `mios_v5.iv_history`, and for the same reason: the store lives in a
`st.cache_resource` object rather than `session_state`, so it survives a rerun and
a second browser tab instead of restarting the collection every time.

## The rules

    · one snapshot per cycle, keyed by time — a rerun that brings no new chain
      must not duplicate the last point, or a stalled feed draws a flat line that
      looks like a settled market
    · MIN_GAP_S between kept snapshots, so the series is time-meaningful
    · CAP snapshots, oldest dropped
    · strikes are stored per snapshot, because ATM DRIFTS: the ±2 window at 09:20
      is not the window at 14:50, and a series that silently re-labels a strike
      would draw two different contracts as one line

⚠️ Absolute OI is stored, not lakhs, and ΔOI as the chain reports it. Unit
conversion belongs to the panel — dividing here would bake a display choice into
the data.

Pure module: the store arrives as a parameter.

#: The fields kept per strike, and the `df_summary` columns each may arrive in.

#: ⚠️ CANDIDATES, not one name. My first version assumed `CE_OI_Change`, which
#: does not exist anywhere in this app — a test asserting the columns against the
#: real source caught it before it shipped. `analyze_option_chain` merges the Dhan
#: names (`openInterest_CE`, `changeinOpenInterest_CE`, `lastPrice_CE`) while
#: other panels read `CE_OI` aliases, so both are accepted and the first one
#: present wins. Guessing a single name is the `fii_net` bug: a lookup that always
#: misses, on a frame that had the data all along.
