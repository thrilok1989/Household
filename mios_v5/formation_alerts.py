"""Alerts for structure forming on a chart — a new high-volume pivot, or a new
Volume Order Block.

Pure by design: signatures and wording only. `vob_minimal` owns the per-chart
memory (what has already been seen) and the send, the same split every other
alert in this file follows.

Both are "formed once, then it exists" events, so the alert must fire on the
FIRST appearance of a thing and never again for the same thing. Deciding what is
new is a question about history, which the app holds — so this module only turns
one pivot or one zone into a stable signature (for the app to diff against its
memory) and into a message. It never decides on its own that something is new,
and it seeds nothing.

The high-volume pivot fields come from `volume_points.high_volume_pivots`
(`side`/`price`/`confirmed_at`/`norm`); the VOB fields from
`vob_minimal.analyze_vob_volume` (`role`/`lower`/`upper`/`status`). Neither is
recomputed here — one owner each (ARCHITECTURE_PRINCIPLES §1).
