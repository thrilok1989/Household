"""MIOS V6 — the Adaptive Greeks layer. Context and confirmation, never a call.

## What this answers

> What is price doing, what are traders doing, what are dealers likely to do
> next, is volatility confirming the move, and does all of that **support or
> weaken** the Guardian verdict?

Not *"which greek predicts the next candle"*. The distinction is the whole
module: greeks describe the terrain a move has to cross. They do not name the
direction of travel.

## The hierarchy, and why the order is the design

    1. PRICE + OI/ΔOI + CVD      what is actually happening        PRIMARY
    2. GEX + DEX                 how dealer hedging will react
    3. VANNA + CHARM             is hedging adding pressure, or a magnet
    4. IV + SKEW                 is volatility confirming the move
    5. GUARDIAN                  the decision — made elsewhere

Layer 1 is measured. Layers 2–4 are *conditions*. A condition can raise or lower
confidence in what layer 1 saw; it can never replace it. So:

* `dealer_posture` is **relative to a flow direction handed in** — it answers
  "does hedging help or hurt THIS move", never "which way is the market going".
* `charm` and `vanna` produce a pressure sign and a magnet distance. Neither
  returns a bias.
* `volatility` returns *confirming · diverging · silent* against a price
  direction, never a direction of its own.

## ⚠️ It emits no recommendation. Ever.

`read()` returns no `side`, no `action`, no `entry`. `assert_no_recommendation`
enforces that on the output, and a test calls it on every regime. The Guardian
consumes this; this does not pre-empt the Guardian.

What it *does* return are **modifiers**: a confidence delta and five
probabilities (breakout · fade · pin · continuation · reversal), each with the
evidence that produced it. Rule 15 of the specification — every conclusion
carries its evidence — is why every scorer returns `(score, evidence)` rather
than a bare number.

## It computes no market data

Every input is already owned and published:

    GEX · gamma flip · magnet     `calculate_dealer_gex`      → gex_disp
    DEX · net delta · tilt        `calculate_dealer_dex`      → dex_bias
    net vanna · net charm         `calculate_vanna_charm_exposure` → vc_exp
    IV skew · put/call IV         `calculate_iv_skew`         → skew_bias
    ATM IV series                 the chain                   → _iv_history
    regime · pin · ΔOI · flow     `compute_market_picture`    → _market_picture
    the expiry charm pin          `mios_v5.charm_pin.read`

⚠️ In particular the expiry pin is **consumed from `charm_pin`**, not re-derived.
That module already owns the rule, its wording and its `context_only` flag, and a
second implementation would let the Trade Card and this layer disagree about
whether the day is pinned.

Pure and deterministic: same inputs, same output, no clock, no network, no
`session_state`.
