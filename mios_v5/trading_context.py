"""Stage 71.95 — the Unified Trading Context.

One immutable object carrying every analysis result a trading decision needs, so
that **Stage 72 reads one thing instead of thirty**.

Not an engine. Not in `ALL_ENGINES`. No Streamlit, no session_state, no network,
no state of its own. It calculates nothing, infers nothing, averages nothing and
mutates nothing — every value is *transported* from the stage that owns it.

## Why this exists

Without it, Stage 72 would read `final_read`, the Opportunity Matrix, Stage
71.7, Stage 71.8, Premium Structure and a dozen `sections.*` nodes directly.
That produces duplicated reads, versions that drift within one cycle, ordering
dependencies nobody wrote down, and a decision whose inputs cannot be listed.

```
Market  →  TradingContext  →  Stage 72  →  Trade Manager  →  Telegram
```

## Every field names its owner ⚠️ BINDING

Principle 12: *nothing may influence a trading decision unless the trader can
inspect that exact value somewhere in the UI.* A value with no owner cannot be
inspected, because nobody knows where to look.

So a field is not a value here — it is a `Field`, carrying `value`, `owner`,
`stage` and the **literal dotted path** it was read from. The path is not
documentation: `_get()` reads it, so a source that goes stale produces `UNKNOWN`
rather than a wrong number, and `owners()` can print the whole table.

## One fact, one owner

Two fields may read the same *object* for different facts — `market.stability`
and `risk.shock` are both Stage 44 — but **no two fields may read the same
path**. That would give one fact two names, and two names drift.

Where the spec asks for a field that *is* another field's value,
`ALIAS` records the pointer instead of copying it. `risk.recovery` is the
example: `RECOVERY` is one of the four values `market.stability` takes, so
reading it separately would be the duplication this module exists to end.

## Immutable after creation

Deep-frozen: mappings become `MappingProxyType`, sequences become tuples, all
the way down. A consumer cannot alter the context it was handed, so two stages
reading the same context in one cycle cannot see different values.
