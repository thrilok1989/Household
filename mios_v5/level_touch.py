"""Alert when price reaches a key level — the war zone, an OI wall, or a ranked
support/resistance — within a small band.

Pure: it decides whether *this* reading of one level should fire, and words the
message. `vob_minimal` owns the memory (the armed/level state per level, which
survives between refreshes), gathers the levels from the reads that own them,
and sends.

The one subtlety is not spamming. The app reruns every ~20 seconds and price can
sit inside the ±band for many of them — so a naive "distance ≤ band → alert"
would fire every cycle while price loiters. `evaluate` latches instead: it
alerts once on entry, disarms, and only re-arms after price has moved clear of
the level by `REARM` (wider than `BAND`, so a wobble at the boundary does not
re-trigger). When the level itself moves (a new war-zone price, a new OI wall)
it re-arms immediately, so the new level's first touch always alerts.
