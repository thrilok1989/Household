"""🏛 Rolling (dynamic) POC per structural window, and the layered read.

Modelled on a multi-timeframe POC indicator whose `pocForTF` approximates each
period's POC as the previous period's `(high + low + close) / 3`. That is a typical
price, not a point of control — it ignores volume entirely, so it lands mid-range
whether the volume traded at the high or the low. These tests pin the difference:
the POC here comes from `htf_vpfr.build_profile`, this repo's ONE POC owner, run
over a sliding window.
