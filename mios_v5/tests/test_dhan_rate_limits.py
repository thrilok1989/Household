"""The app must stay inside Dhan's published rate limits.

From Dhan's docs:

  Quote APIs (marketfeed/ltp, marketfeed/quote)  1 request / second
  Data APIs (intraday, historical)               5 / second, 100k / day
  Option Chain                                   "one unique request every
                                                  3 seconds"

The option chain is the strictest and was the only fetch with no throttle at
all — `get_dhan_option_chain` was a bare post, called once for the main read
and three more times inside the cross-expiry loop, back to back. Four requests
into a window that permits one per three seconds.

Two of those four were the *same* request: the main read takes `expiry[0]` and
the cross-expiry loop iterates `expiry[:3]`, whose first element is the same
expiry. With no cache on the function, that was fetched twice every cycle.

`vob_minimal` boots Streamlit on import, so these are source-level checks.
