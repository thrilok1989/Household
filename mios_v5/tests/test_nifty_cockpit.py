"""🧭 Dashboard 1 — the NIFTY index cockpit.

Five blocks, five questions about the index. The properties worth testing are
not "does it draw" but the two that make a display panel trustworthy:

1. **It never invents a number.** A missing reading renders `—`, never `0`.
   Zero is a market fact — perfectly balanced flow, a wall that did not move —
   and printing one that was never measured is fabricating data the reader
   cannot tell apart from the real thing.
2. **It never re-derives an owned fact.** `compute_market_picture` owns which
   strike the wall is on; `rank_levels` owns the S/R order. A second
   implementation that disagreed by one strike would be worse than no panel.

The module is pure — data in, HTML out, no streamlit and no session state — so
all of this is testable without a market.
