"""Every deployed dependency is bounded above, and none is raised past what
the deployment can install.

There are two failure modes here and they pull in opposite directions.

**Unbounded.** Thirteen bare `>=` let Streamlit Cloud re-resolve the tree on
every rebuild and cross a major version with nothing asking. Streamlit serves
hash-named JS chunks, so a rebuild onto a different version renames them and a
browser holding the previous `index.html` requests files that no longer exist:
`Failed to fetch dynamically imported module`.

**Over-pinned.** The first attempt at fixing that pinned the floors to the
versions installed in *this sandbox* — `pandas~=3.0.5`, `numpy~=2.4.6`,
`streamlit==1.60.0`. The deploy then failed outright with "Error installing
requirements", because pandas 3.x needs Python >=3.11 and nothing in this repo
knows which Python Streamlit Cloud runs. A green suite in a sandbox is not
evidence about a deployment target.

So the rule these tests encode is asymmetric, and deliberately so:

* an upper cap is always safe — it only removes future versions
* **a raised floor is not** — it demands a version the target may not have

The sandbox may not dictate the deployment's floors.
