"""⛶ Every chart on the Charts tab carries the one Fullscreen button.

The button is Streamlit's, injected into the Plotly modebar. `displayModeBar: False`
removed the whole modebar and the button with it — which is why the terminal chart,
the one a trader most wants to enlarge, was the only chart that could not be. These
tests pin the shared config on all three chart calls and the CSS that makes the
button visible rather than hover-only.
