"""🔢 Dashboard V6 — the tab bodies must run in dependency order.

## The bug

`st.tabs()` returns containers that can be filled in ANY sequence; the strip's
left-to-right order is fixed by `_TABS` and is unaffected. Filling them in tab
order therefore looked harmless and was not, because there is a real dependency
between the bodies:

    _charts_screen      writes  _leg_profiles
    _trading_screen     reads   _leg_profiles
                        writes  _sr_levels · _premium_energy
                                _premium_structures · _entry_decision
    _nifty_cockpit      reads   _sr_levels · _entry_decision
    _options_cockpit    reads   _premium_energy · _premium_structures

The three new cockpits were moved to the FRONT of the strip. Their producer was
not, so they ran before it:

* first render of a session — the keys did not exist, the blocks drew nothing,
  and the tab printed *"⚪ Not reporting yet: sr table"* /
  *"premium energy · premium structure · option flow"*;
* every render after — they silently showed the PREVIOUS cycle's data, one 20s
  cycle behind the panels beside them, which is the worse failure because it
  looks like it is working.

## Why this test computes the graph instead of hardcoding an order

Hardcoding "fill 0, then 4, then 1" pins the symptom. Deriving producers and
consumers from the AST pins the *rule*, so moving a tab, adding a block, or
moving a `session_state` write between functions is checked on its own terms.
