"""The Liquidity Context — computed once per cycle, read by every stage.

The specification's own runtime rule:

> *Compute liquidity once per refresh. Expose a centralized Liquidity Context
> object. Every stage reads from this object. Do not recompute inside
> individual stages.*

That is `TradingContext` (Stage 71.95) applied to liquidity, and it is built the
same way for the same reasons: a field is not a value, it is a `Field` carrying
`value`, `owner`, `stage` and the **literal dotted path** it was read from.
Principle 12 — nothing may influence a trading decision unless the trader can
inspect that exact value somewhere.

## Three charts, one object

The specification asks for profiles on NIFTY, on the premium, and on the option
chain. `docs/AUDIT_LIQUIDITY_INTELLIGENCE.md` found that the **premium chart is
already fully covered by Stage 71.8**, and the option chain by six values that
exist and get collapsed into a glyph. So this object does not rebuild either —
it carries all three, reading 71.8 for the premium and the chain fields from
where they already live.

## Why the profiles are arguments and not computed here

`calculate_money_flow_profile` is a Python loop over every bar × every bin, and
`compute_dynamic_poc` runs a histogram per bar. At a 20-second refresh those
cannot run once per stage — which is exactly what this object prevents — but
they also must not run inside a *context builder*, because a context that
computes is a context whose cost nobody can see. The caller builds the profiles
once, and hands them in finished.

## Immutable, and honest about what is missing

Deep-frozen, reusing Stage 71.95's `_freeze`. An absent producer yields
`UNKNOWN`, never `0` — a zero on a liquidity reading looks like a measurement.
`missing()` names what did not report and `coverage()` says how much of the
object this cycle filled.
