"""MIOS V6 — Dashboard V6: the Market Intelligence Workstation.

Not a charting app. A **persistent header** plus six screens, each answering ONE
question:

    1 Decision      should I trade right now?          — the action panel
    2 Trading       where exactly?                     — the cockpit
    3 Intelligence  why does MIOS think that?          — the engine room
    4 History       what happened, and why?            — case studies
    5 Learning      is MIOS actually any good?         — analytics
    6 Replay        can I verify it, cycle by cycle?   — the recording

The split that makes it usable is **2 vs 3**: Dashboard 2 is where a trader
lives during the session and must carry only what you act on; Dashboard 3 is
diagnostics and can be as dense as it likes because you go there deliberately.
Mixing them produces a screen that is too noisy to trade from and too shallow to
debug with.

The header is sticky and identical on every tab. A trader reading a post-trade
review on Dashboard 4 is exactly the one most likely to have stopped watching
the tape — the header is what stops a flow shift happening off-screen.

Highlight CHANGES, not static values: a panel that repeats the same number every
cycle trains the eye to skip it.

#: 📊 Charts leads, so the synchronised NIFTY ‖ CALL ‖ PUT figure sits directly
#: under the price header instead of four blocks down the Trading tab.
#:
#: ⚠️ This list is the STRIP's layout only — it does not decide what runs first.
#:
#: Streamlit executes each tab body when its container is FILLED, and
#: `render_dashboard_v6` fills them in dependency order, not in this order. So
#: moving a label here is safe; what matters is the fill sequence, and
#: `test_screen_order.py` checks that against the real producer/consumer graph.
#:
#: Charts still has to execute before Trading — `_terminal_chart` is the only
#: producer of `_leg_profiles` (one of the four CRITICAL panels, see
#: `docs/AUDIT_FOCUS_MODE.md`) and `_trading_screen` reads it for the per-leg
#: liquidity bars — but that is enforced by the fill order, not by this list.

#: One limit per table, shared by every panel that reads it.
#:
#: ⚠️ The read cache keys on the arguments, so `get_session_log(4000)` and
#: `get_session_log(8000)` were two entries and two round-trips for the same
#: rows — and Streamlit runs every tab body on every rerun, so both panels
#: asked whether or not anyone opened them. A panel that wants fewer rows
#: slices the shared result; it must not ask a different question.

#: The Plotly config every chart on the Charts tab shares: a modebar stripped to the
#: single Fullscreen button Streamlit injects, with scroll-zoom off.
#:
#: ⚠️ The terminal chart passed `displayModeBar: False`, which removed the whole
#: modebar — and with it the Fullscreen button Streamlit adds to the modebar. So the
#: one chart a trader most wants to enlarge was the only one with no way to. The OI
#: and POC charts used the default config, which DID carry the button, but only in a
#: hover-only modebar top-right — discoverable enough to be reported missing.
#:
#: `scrollZoom: False` is kept from the terminal's old config: the wheel zoomed the
#: chart out from under anyone scrolling the page past it. Every pan/zoom/select/reset
#: button is removed, so what remains is exactly the one Fullscreen control — verified
#: on screen, not assumed, since `modeBarButtonsToRemove` only names Plotly's own
#: buttons and the Fullscreen one is Streamlit's.

#: The four learning reads, under the same rule — and they are the heaviest
#: in the app.
#:
#: ⚠️ Round 3 applied the one-limit rule to the two tables above and missed
#: these, which were being asked at **three** limits each from three panels:
#:
#:     get_engine_attribution   2,000 · 8,000 · 3,000   → 13,000 rows
#:     get_trade_events         1,000 · 4,000 · 1,500   →  6,500 rows
#:     get_trade_results           40 ·   500 ·    60   →    600 rows
#:     get_trade_attribution       40 ·   500 ·    60   →    600 rows
#:
#: Three cache entries, three round-trips, overlapping rows — and all three
#: panels run on every rerun whether or not their tab is open, so every
#: invalidation and every cold start paid for all three.
#:
#: Each limit below is the **widest** of the three, so no panel loses a row.
#: `_learning_rows` returns newest-first, which is what makes a slice
#: equivalent to a narrower query: `rows[:60]` is the same sixty rows

    calls — NOT the Intelligence tab, as this said. Because the tab bodies were
    filled in tab order, this cockpit (tab 1) ran before that producer (tab 4):
    the table was empty on the first rerun of a session and showed the PREVIOUS
    cycle's levels on every rerun after.

    The old note concluded that fixing it would mean moving a CRITICAL producer.
    It would not: `st.tabs()` containers may be filled in any sequence and the
    strip's layout is unaffected, so `render_dashboard_v6` now fills Trading
    before the cockpits and nothing moved on screen. See `test_screen_order.py`.

    The NIFTY read is Dashboard 1's. Repeating it here is the duplication the
    split exists to remove, so this tab draws no spot, no regime and no index
    levels.

    **Reads only.** Every field has a stage that published it:

        Stage 71.8 `_premium_structures`  ltp · support · resistance · vp_poc ·

        Stage 71.7 `_premium_energy`      energy · spike · strength · preferred
        the chain  `df_summary`           LTP · OI · ΔOI · volume · bid/ask

    `_premium_structures` is keyed by `(side, strike)` TUPLES. Re-keying is done
    here rather than asking the pure module to understand a tuple key, which is
    the same boundary rename `_mios_market_read` does.

    ⚠️ FIXED — this note used to end "So on the first rerun of a session the
    structure and flow blocks are empty and fill on the next", which recorded a
    real bug as accepted behaviour. Stage 71.8 publishes `_premium_structures`
    from `_strike_validation` on the Trading tab, and filling the tabs in tab
    order ran this cockpit first, so those blocks showed nothing on the first
    rerun and the PREVIOUS cycle's data on every one after.
    `render_dashboard_v6` now fills Trading before the cockpits — the strip is
    unchanged, since `st.tabs()` containers may be filled in any sequence. See

      `EntryDecision` carrying its own id, version, created_at and hash.
    * **73** takes that decision and the same context and returns a lifecycle
      action — it never mints its own id, it carries 72's forward.
    * **72.9** takes both and prepares a dispatch.

    ⚠️ **It sends only when a human has switched sending on.** The transport
    is read from `session_state["_mios_transport"]`, which the app sets *only*
    while the "MIOS V6 Telegram signals" toggle is on. With the toggle off the
    key is absent, the dispatcher receives `None`, builds the payload, decides
    whether it *would* send, and reports `NOT_SENT` — exactly as before.

    Stage 72.9 is still `VALIDATED_SIMULATED` with `freeze_ready: False`: five
    hundred live dispatches have not happened. The toggle is the human decision
    that report asks for, not a replacement for it, and the panel says so.
