"""The option legs' S/R read, as a table BELOW the charts.

`classify_leg_sr_behavior` classifies each leg's own VOB structure against its
own LTP every cycle — BREAKING / REJECTING / ACCEPTING / BUILDING — and the
chart marks the level it is about. This is the same read in numbers: which
level, how far the leg is from it, and which way the verdict points for that
leg's own premium.

Pure: reads the analysis and returns rows / HTML. No `st`, no I/O — the same
shape `price_action_table` uses for the geometric patterns beneath the same
charts.

Direction is from the LEG'S OWN perspective, which is the axis the panel above
shows. A call breaking its own resistance is bullish for that call; what that
implies for the index is a separate read and is deliberately not restated here.
