"""Stage 72's payload, rendered as a message a human reads.

**Presentation only.** Every value here was decided by Stage 72 or Stage 73;
this file chooses wording and layout and nothing else. It is in `ui/` for that
reason — the dispatcher is explicit that it *"does not modify the payload's
wording"*, so the wording has to live somewhere that is allowed to have taste.

## It cannot invent a level

The single rule this file exists to enforce: **an `UNKNOWN` never renders as a
number.** Stage 72 publishes `target2` and `target3` as `UNKNOWN` by name
(`MISSING_PRODUCERS`), because Stage 35 publishes one target and a ladder would
be fabricated. A template with three hard-coded target lines renders three
targets whether or not two of them exist — in the one artefact a trader acts on.

So every field goes through `_v()`, absent rows are **dropped entirely** rather
than printed with a dash, and a test asserts no `UNKNOWN` reaches the output.

## Entry and exit are the same object

An entry message comes from the `EntryDecision`; an exit message comes from the
`TradeLifecycleDecision` that references it. They share an id, so a trader can
see that the exit belongs to the entry they were sent twenty minutes ago —
which is the whole reason Stage 73 references rather than mints.
