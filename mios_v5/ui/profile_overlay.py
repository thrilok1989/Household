"""The liquidity & sentiment profile, drawn on a price panel.

Pure presentation. Every value here was computed by somebody else — the bins by
`calculate_money_flow_profile`, the POC and value area by `compute_vpfr` (the
one POC owner, audit 71.8), the shape by Stage 71.86. This file decides where
things sit and what colour they are, and nothing else.

## Why the bins are drawn as a band, not a histogram

A Plotly price panel has one x-axis and it is time. A volume-profile histogram
needs a second, and faking one with a bar trace puts volume bars *in the
timeline*, where they read as trades that happened at those moments. So the
profile is drawn as **full-width horizontal bands whose opacity carries the
volume** — a heavy level is a strong band, a thin level is nearly invisible.

Opacity rather than width keeps every level anchored to its own price, which is
the only thing a trader reads off a profile in the first place.

## Sentiment colours the band, volume sets its strength

Two facts on one mark, and they are independent: `sentiment` (which side traded
there) picks the hue, `ratio` (how much traded there) picks the opacity. A
heavy bullish node and a thin bullish node are the same colour at different
strengths, which is what makes the heavy one findable at a glance.

`Neutral` sentiment is grey rather than a blend — a bin where buyers and
sellers were even is not a weak bull bin.

## Nothing is drawn that was not reported

A missing POC draws no line. A bin with no volume draws no band. There is no
placeholder mark anywhere in this file, because a placeholder on a price chart
is a level that does not exist rendered at a price that does.
