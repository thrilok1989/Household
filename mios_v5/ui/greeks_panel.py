"""⚙️ The Adaptive Greeks read, in the eight lines the spec asks for.

Not twenty Greek numbers — eight readings a trader acts on:

    DEALER POSITION   🟢 supportive · 🔴 opposing · 🟡 neutral
    GAMMA             positive / negative · flip level
    HEDGING PRESSURE  ↑ upward · ↓ downward · ↔ neutral
    PIN / MAGNET      ₹level · distance
    VOLATILITY        expanding / contracting / neutral
    BREAKOUT RISK     LOW / MEDIUM / HIGH
    FADE RISK         LOW / MEDIUM / HIGH
    GUARDIAN          the verdict + confidence, READ from the decision

⚠️ The Guardian line is **read, never produced here**. `adaptive_greeks` emits no
side (`assert_no_recommendation` enforces it), so the verdict and its confidence
arrive as parameters from whatever already decided them. This panel shows the
greeks *next to* that verdict — that is the whole point of the layer, and a panel
that minted its own BUY would undo it.

Every conclusion carries its evidence (rule 15): the reason line under the
verdict is assembled from the layer's own `evidence` and `conflicts`, never
re-worded.

Pure module — data in, HTML out.
