**One figure, not three.** This is the decision that makes the layout work.
Streamlit columns would give three independent Plotly figures, and Plotly can
only synchronise axes *within* a figure — so three figures means three
independently-scrolling charts, which is precisely what the terminal must not
be. A single figure with a `rowspan` cell and `matches="x"` on every axis gives
the requested proportions **and** real synchronised zoom, pan and crosshair.

`matches="x"` rather than `shared_xaxes=True`: the latter only links subplots
within a column, and NIFTY is in a different column from the option legs.

Each panel's levels belong to its own axis. Overlaying a spot-derived stop on
an option's price series would put a line at a price that series can never
trade — authoritative-looking and meaningless. So the option panels draw the
legs' own levels, from the legs' own engines, in premium.

The one exception is `⇢` projected levels, and it is an exception only in
appearance: `leg_projection` reports what a leg **actually traded at** the last
few times NIFTY was near the level. That number is measured off the shared
timeline, not converted from index points, so it belongs to the premium axis
like every other line on the panel. It is drawn `longdashdot` and labelled with
an arrow so it is never mistaken for the leg's own structure.

Tinting is applied as a below-layer rectangle rather than a plot background so
the candles keep their own colours. A chart whose body colour competes with its
candles is harder to read, not easier.

Not a pure module — it builds a Plotly figure. It computes no market logic.
