"""🏛 Rolling (dynamic) POC per structural window — the multi-TF POC picture.

## What "dynamic POC" means here

A **static** POC is one number for a finished period: last week's POC, drawn as a
horizontal line until the week rolls over. It only moves on the period boundary, so
for four days out of five it tells you where value *was*.

A **dynamic** POC is recomputed on every bar over a trailing window, so it is a
LINE that moves with the market. `poc_line(..., window=5)` gives the weekly POC as
it looked on each day, which is the picture the layered-structure read is actually
about: not four horizontal lines, but four curves whose ORDER tells you which way
structure is migrating.

⚠️ **The POC itself is not computed here.** `htf_vpfr.build_profile` is this repo's
one POC owner — the audit found four implementations and picked it — and a rolling
POC is that same function over a sliding window. A fifth implementation, however
convenient, would put this module in the business of deciding what a POC is.

The reference indicator this was modelled on approximates each period's POC as the
previous period's `(high + low + close) / 3`. That is a typical price, not a point
of control: it ignores volume entirely, so it lands in the middle of a bar's range
whether the volume was transacted at the high or the low. `build_profile` bins real
volume across the prices each bar spanned. The lines here are therefore not the
same lines — they are the ones the reference was reaching for.

## Windows, and why they are named in days

On a **1-day** axis a "4H POC" cannot be a series — four hours is finer than one
bar, so there is nothing to roll. Rather than mislabel a 5-day window as "4H", the
windows here are named for what they are, and `SUBDAILY` records which of the
reference's timeframes are levels rather than curves.

Pure module: sequences in, dicts out. No pandas, no plotly, no session, no I/O.
