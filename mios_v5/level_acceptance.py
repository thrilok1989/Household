"""MIOS — Level Acceptance / Rejection observation strip (context-only).

It answers one question the predictive breakout/rejection % cannot: **after price
interacted with a level, did the market ACCEPT the new area or REJECT it?** —
observed, not predicted.

## It computes no state machine of its own

The temporal follow-through logic already exists and is tested: `mios_v5.
acceptance.evaluate_reaction` (Stage 42). This module **reuses** it and does only
the three presentation jobs the trader asked for:

1. **Maps** that engine's rich verdict (TOUCH · WATCHING · BREAK · ACCEPTANCE ·
   REJECTION · ABSORPTION · TRAP · SWEEP · CONFIRMED/FAILED …) onto ONE compact
   six-word vocabulary — `TESTING`, `BREAK_ATTEMPT`, `ACCEPTED_ABOVE`,
   `ACCEPTED_BELOW`, `FAILED_BREAK_WAIT`, `REJECTED`.
2. **Runs it per level** across the full level set (dealer magnet, gamma flip,
   S/R, POC, VAH/VAL, OI walls …), each carrying its own memory. A level's
   "side" is inferred from spot: a price overhead acts as resistance, below as
   support — exactly how the level behaves.
3. **Clusters** levels sitting within tolerance into one *battle zone*, so four
   numbers a point apart read as one event, not four.

## Non-negotiables (mirrors the engine it wraps)

* `context_only` is always True. It emits no BUY/SELL, never feeds Guardian, and
  the predictive breakout/rejection % is untouched — this reports separately what
  price actually DID.
* **TESTING is not rejection**, and a break that fails is `FAILED_BREAK_WAIT`
  (never a premature "fakeout"/REJECTED) until the engine confirms the reversal.
* A metric that was not measured is dropped, never invented — the confirmation
  score is `passed / known`, so an unavailable check lowers neither.

Pure module: numbers/dicts in, dicts out. No pandas, no session, no I/O. The
reaction function is injected (default the real one) so the mapping and
clustering are testable without the heavy engine.
