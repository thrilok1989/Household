-- Stage 74 telemetry — the calibration evidence, collected before injection.
-- Contract: docs/STAGE74_LEVEL_CONTRACT.md · module: mios_v5/liquidity_telemetry.py
--
-- Stage 74's confidence curve, cluster tolerance and POC regime bands were set
-- from reasoning, because there was nothing to measure. This table is how they
-- stop being reasoning: one row per sample, a week of sessions, then a verdict
-- on whether the curve discriminates.
--
-- It exists BEFORE the S/R injection on purpose. Once Stage 42 consumes these
-- values, changing the scoring changes downstream engine behaviour too, and the
-- cheap window to calibrate closes.
--
-- ⚠️ The app samples at most once a minute, not once per 20-second rerun.
--    A trading day is ~375 rows, a week ~1,900. Small, and retention is set in
--    db/retention.py (180 days) so it cannot grow forever like every other
--    table in this schema did.

COMMENT ON COLUMN liquidity_telemetry.confidence_unscored IS
    'Clusters whose confidence was UNKNOWN. Counted apart from the histogram: '
    'an unscored cluster is not a low-confidence one, and folding it in would '
    'drag the distribution toward TOO_HARSH for the wrong reason.';
