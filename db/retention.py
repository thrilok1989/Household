"""Data retention — the policies the migrations declared, finally executed.

Every `sql/*.sql` migration that creates a growing table ends the same way:

```sql
-- optional purge (keep ~30 days)
-- DELETE FROM engine_errors WHERE trading_day < CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30 days';
```

Ten tables carry a policy like that. **All ten are commented out**, and
`SupabaseDB.delete_rows` — written for exactly this — has never had a caller. So
nothing has ever purged anything, and every table has been growing since the day
it was created.

This module executes those policies. It does not invent them: where a migration
declared a retention period, that number is used verbatim and `Policy.source`
names the file it came from. The tables with no declared policy get one here,
and those are marked `source="this module"` so the distinction stays visible.

## Deleting is not cacheable, reversible, or undoable ⚠️ BINDING

`ENABLED = False`, and a human flips it — the same promotion gate
`advisory_only` uses everywhere else in this codebase.

Until then `preview()` is fully functional and `run()` refuses. That is not
timidity: the first purge on a two-year-old table removes rows nobody has looked
at in months, and *"how many would go?"* has a right answer that costs nothing
to ask. A trader should see the number before the rows stop existing.

`PROTECTED` names the tables no policy may ever touch, enabled or not.
`my_analysis` is the clearest case — a trader's own written notes, which no
retention window has any business expiring.

## How a purge runs

Forward from the oldest row, in bounded windows, oldest first:

* one `DELETE` across two years of a busy table is how a statement timeout
  happens, and a timeout leaves the table exactly as big as it was
* windowed, a timeout costs one window; the next run resumes from the new
  oldest row
* oldest-first means an interrupted purge still shrinks the table

Every run appends to `retention_log` — table, policy, cutoff, rows before,
rows removed, and whether it was a preview. A deletion with no record of what
it deleted is indistinguishable from data loss.
