# `db/read_cache.py` reduced how OFTEN a read reaches Supabase. It cannot
# reduce how BIG the read is, and the fetches it cannot remove are the
# expensive ones: the cold-start pass after every restart, and the refetch
# every invalidation forces. Those pay full row width every time.
#
# 52 of 61 reads were `select('*')`. `tools/egress_meter.py` named this the
# largest remaining item and deferred it for a stated reason:
#
#   > narrowing a column list is a per-call-site decision: each one needs its
#   > consumers checked, and getting it wrong renders a blank field rather
#   > than a slow one.
#
# So this narrows exactly two reads — the two with the most rows AND a JSONB
# blob column that **no read consumer touches**. A JSON snapshot dwarfs every
# numeric column beside it, so dropping one blob from an 8,000-row read is
# worth more than narrowing thirty small ones.
#
# ⚠️ An inclusion list has one dangerous failure mode: a column added to the
# table later is silently omitted, and a silently missing column is precisely
# the blank field the audit warned about. `test_read_projections.py` closes
# that by re-deriving each list from `sql/*.sql` — add a column to the schema
# without adding it here and the suite fails instead of the panel.
#
#: table → the columns a read of it needs, and why the omitted one is safe.
