"""Stage 1 of Focus Mode — which panels may be skipped, and which may not.

Focus Mode shows the header and a minimal chart and hides everything else. The
danger is not the hiding. It is that **compute and draw are entangled**: three of
the header's own inputs — `_premium_energy`, `_trading_context`,
`_premium_structures` — are written *inside* `dashboard_v6`'s render path, and
`_trading_context` is what Stage 72 → 73 → 72.9 → Telegram reads. Skip the wrong
render and the alerts go quiet with nothing on screen to say so, which has
already happened three times in this repo.

So the rule this tool exists to enforce:

> **Focus Mode may suppress presentation. It may not suppress computation
> required by MIOS state, the decision stages, or Telegram alerts.**

## What it decides

For every function reachable from the render entry points, it answers one
question: *if this were not called, would anything else lose an input?*

* **DRAW-ONLY** — writes nothing that anyone outside it reads. Safe to skip.
* **PRODUCER** — writes a session-state key someone else reads. Must keep
  running, and Stage 4 has to split its compute from its draw.
* **CRITICAL** — a producer whose key is in `PROTECTED`: the header, the charts,
  or the alert chain depends on it. Skipping it is the regression.

## How the call graph is built, and its limit

Functions are matched **by name**, because this repo calls across modules by
bare name after a local import (`from .foo import bar` then `bar(...)`). Two
functions sharing a name are therefore merged, which can only ever make a panel
look like it writes MORE than it does.

That bias is deliberate: the expensive mistake is calling a producer draw-only,
not the reverse. A false PRODUCER costs a panel that keeps running; a false
DRAW-ONLY costs the Telegram chain.
