# Part 0 — How to read this

## The single most important idea

This application is **four generations of software running at the same time**,
on the same data, in the same page. Nothing was deleted when the next
generation was built. That is deliberate — the project's governing rule is:

> **Every engine ships observational-only and logged. Nothing influences a
> decision until it has proven itself.** Promotion requires 2–4 weeks of live
> data. This rule outranks every other item on the roadmap.

So when you see two numbers disagree on screen, that is usually **the system
working as designed**, not a bug. The disagreement is the data that decides
which generation gets promoted.

## The four generations

| Gen | Name | Lives in | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| **1** | The native app | `vob_minimal.py` | **LIVE** — drives real alerts |
| **2** | MIOS V5 | `mios_v5/` stages 0–41 | **LIVE** — supplies the headline bias |
| **3** | MIOS V6 | `mios_v5/` stages 37, 42–54, 68–69 | **OBSERVATIONAL** |
| **4** | Decision Engines | `decision.py` (v0), `stage52` (v2) | **OBSERVATIONAL** |

**Only Generation 1 can fire an alert or arm a trade.** Everything else
computes, displays, and logs.

## How to tell which generation a number came from

Three rules, in order:

1. **Is it on the Trade Card?** Look at the section heading — the card is split
   into `📊 MARKET FACTS`, `🧭 MIOS V5`, `🧬 MIOS V6`, `🎯 DECISIONS`.
2. **Does it have a stage number?** `≤ 41` → V5. `37, 42–54, 68–70` → V6.
   `55–67` → V6.5 explainability/learning (never a signal).
3. **Does it carry `advisory_only: True`?** Then it is observational, full stop.

## 1.1 · Which file actually runs

`vob_minimal.py`. Everything else is either imported by it, or a separate
process. Despite the name it is the **largest** file in the repo (1.87 MB).
The name is historical.

## 1.2 · `vob (5).py` — deleted, and where it went

Until recently the repo carried a second 27,347-line application file. It was
**not** a backup of `vob_minimal.py`: it shared only 61 top-level definitions,
had 113 the running app lacks (`MasterDataEngine`, `UltimateRSI`, its own
inline `SupabaseDB`, the `_bn_` / `_fae_` / `_fii_` / `_amie_` families), and
was missing 281 the running app has. Two divergent siblings, neither
superseding the other, and no way for a newcomer to tell which was real.

It has been **deleted**. Nothing imported it and no CI referenced it.

`vob_minimal.py` still carries four comments recording code ported *from* it
(around lines 3042, 4947, 6706, 30638). Those are accurate provenance — the
code did come from there — and the file itself is recoverable from git
history if a port ever needs re-checking:

```bash
git log --all --oneline -- "vob (5).py"      # find a commit that had it
git show <commit>:"vob (5).py" > /tmp/vob5.py
```

**There is now exactly one executable application in this repo.**

# Part 2 — The file: `vob_minimal.py`

## 2.1 · Boot sequence (what runs at import, before any UI)

Lines 1–208, in this exact order:

| Lines | What happens | Why it matters |
|---|---|---|
| 1–24 | Imports | `mios_v5` is imported here — a broken engine package breaks boot |
| 26–33 | `_mios_stamp()` | Renders IST correctly. Supabase returns UTC; appending " IST" to a UTC string made a 12:15 bar read "06:45:00 IST" |
| 35–47 | Optional imports | `yfinance`, `google.genai` behind `try` → `_HAS_YF`, `_HAS_GEMINI` |
| 49–55 | `st.set_page_config` | Must be the first Streamlit call |
| 57–63 | **Market-hours gate** | `st_autorefresh(20000ms)` fires **only** inside 08:30–15:45 IST, weekdays. Computed **at import time** |
| 65–125 | CSS | Anti-flicker rules + the `@media (max-width: 640px)` mobile block |
| 126–196 | Secrets | Dhan · Supabase · Telegram ×2 · Discord · Gemini · Anthropic · Groq |
| 198–208 | Constants | `NIFTY_UNDERLYING_SCRIP = 13` · `INSTRUMENT_CONFIGS` |

⚠️ **The refresh gate is evaluated once, at import.** A session left open
across 15:45 keeps refreshing until the page is reloaded.

## 2.2 · Region map

| Lines | Region |
|---|---|
| 211–673 | Alert plumbing — Telegram/Discord senders, allow-lists, execution-plan template |
| 675–886 | `DhanAPI` — the **only** HTTP client for broker data |
| 888–1180 | Dhan fetch helpers + `@st.cache_data` wrappers |
| 1181–2058 | Indicator classes — `PivotIndicator`, `VolumeOrderBlocks`, `TriplePOC`, `FutureSwing`, `ReversalDetector`, `compute_vpfr` |
| 2060–3174 | Options math — max pain, GEX, DEX, IV skew/rank, vanna/charm, Black-Scholes |
| 3176–4941 | Four named engines — `GeometricPatternDetector`, CIE, CMCE, IOFCE |
| 4942–6300 | Liquidity-grab / stop-hunt detection + ~15 throttled alert senders |
| 6310–7620 | Charting + `analyze_option_chain` |
| 8032–9700 | TA detectors + external-data panels (sector, commodity, global, news) |
| 9823–10945 | `generate_master_signal` + AI explanation |
| 11006–12660 | S/R proximity alerts + the S/R zone engine |
| 13188–16346 | `compute_composite_bias` → `compute_market_picture` → `render_market_picture` |
| 16347–17632 | Lite/mobile gating · decision performance · signal lifecycle |
| 17633–19536 | **Trade Card** · all-bias dashboard |
| 19537–23450 | AI advisor · leg-level engines (per-strike CE/PE) · entry decisions |
| 24851–26456 | `send_master_signal_telegram` (1,599 lines) |
| 27982–35817 | **`_render_main_analyzer`** — 7,833 lines, the whole page |
| 35818–35843 | `main()` |

## 2.3 · The four functions over 600 lines

| Lines | Function | Note |
|---|---|---|
| 7,833 | `_render_main_analyzer` | The entire page |
| 1,599 | `send_master_signal_telegram` | One Telegram message |
| 1,183 | `render_market_picture` | |
| 982 | `compute_composite_bias` | **Pure computation, no Streamlit** — the cleanest extraction candidate |

## 2.4 · `session_state` is the message bus

996 references, ~112 distinct private `_`-prefixed keys. Compute functions
stash; render functions read. The critical ones:

| Key | Written by | Read by |
|---|---|---|
| `_cached_option_data` | `analyze_option_chain` | everything downstream |
| `_last_df` | the candle fetch | MIOS, charts, all TA |
| `_market_picture` | `compute_market_picture` | Trade Card, Entry Gate, mobile view |
| `_reaction_sr` | `build_reaction_sr` | Trade Card, Cockpit, v0, D2 |
| `_mios_state` | `run_mios_pass` | every V5/V6 panel |
| `_leg_bias_cache` | `build_leg_bias_table` | D2 terminal, leg cards |
| `_money_flow_data` | `calculate_money_flow_profile` | VAL/POC/VAH everywhere |
| `_entry_gate_active` | the Entry Gate | Trade Card, Guardian |
| `_mios_decision` | `build_mios_decision_and_log` | Trade Card DECISIONS |

⚠️ **Ordering is load-bearing.** See §4.

# Part 3 — The data layer

## 3.1 · Dhan API v2 — `DhanAPI` (line 675)

The **only** class that talks to the broker.

| Method | Endpoint | Returns |
|---|---|---|
| `get_intraday_data` | `/charts/intraday` | OHLCV candles |
| `get_ltp_data` | `/marketfeed/ltp` | last price |
| `get_quote` | `/marketfeed/quote` | LTP + volume + OI + OHLC |
| `place_order` | `/orders` | order id |
| `get_positions` / `get_orders` | `/positions`, `/orders` | book |

**Rate-limit discipline** (`_handle_response`, line 687):

- **401** → sets `_dhan_token_expired`, shows the sidebar refresh prompt
- **429 (DH-904)** → sets `_dhan_429_until = now + 90s`. Every caller checks
  this and serves cached data instead. Notification throttled to once per 30s
- **0.3s minimum gap** between intraday calls so leg fetches don't burst
- `get_quote` falls back to `/marketfeed/ltp` on a 200-but-empty response,
  returning `{'_ltp_only': True}` so the caller knows OI/volume are missing

## 3.2 · Supabase — `db/supabase_client.py`

75 KB. Handles reads, writes, and an offline **pending queue** (`sync_pending()`
runs at the top of every cycle). See Part 11.

## 3.3 · yfinance

Global indices, commodities, sector proxies, HTF daily bars for Stage 45.
Entirely optional — guarded by `_HAS_YF`.

## 3.4 · The indicator owners ⚠️ BINDING

`docs/ARCHITECTURE_PRINCIPLES.md` names exactly one owner per market fact.
**No other module may recompute these.**

| Fact | Owner |
|---|---|
| Buy/sell split, CVD, CBV, CSV | `indicators/order_flow.py` |
| Money Flow Profile | `indicators/money_flow_profile.py::calculate_money_flow_profile` |
| Candle Delta Volume | `indicators/volume_delta.py::calculate_volume_delta` |
| VPFR | `vob_minimal.py::compute_vpfr` |
| VOB | `vob_minimal.py::analyze_vob_volume` |

`mios_v5/order_flow_snapshot.py::OWNERS` is the machine-readable version.

## 3.5 · The trust tiers ⚠️ BINDING

Every `EngineResult` carries a `Provenance.tier`:

| Tier | Meaning | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **1 — EXECUTED** | Traded prints. Cannot be faked | volume, CVD, delta |
| **2 — DERIVED** | Modeled but trustworthy | greeks, OI, profiles |
| **3 — RESTING** | Quotes / stated intent. **Spoofable** | bid/ask depth |

This is why Stage 15 (Microstructure) is **DISABLED**: iceberg and spoofing
detection need L2 depth that retail Dhan does not provide. The project's
position is that fabricating it would be worse than not having it.

## 3.6 · `MISSING` is not zero ⚠️ BINDING

```python
from indicators.order_flow import MISSING, is_missing
assert MISSING != 0      # the whole point
assert not MISSING       # falsy, so `if not x:` still guards
```

Zero is a **market fact** — perfectly balanced flow. Asserting one that was
never observed is fabricating data, and the consumer cannot tell the
difference.

# Part 4 — The refresh cycle

## 4.1 · What triggers it

`st_autorefresh(interval=20000)` — every 20 seconds, weekdays 08:30–15:45 IST
only. Streamlit re-runs the **entire script** top to bottom on each tick.

## 4.2 · The order, and why it is load-bearing

```
 1. restore_app_state()            ← pull composites from Supabase (once/session)
 2. maybe_play_combo_audio()
 3. top buttons · Lite/Full toggle
 4. RESERVE containers             ← _clean_card, _all_bias, _v6, _v5, …
 5. market-hours check
 6. session_state defaults
 7. SupabaseDB() + db.sync_pending()
 8. define _mios_pass()            ← DEFINED here, NOT called
 9. hydrate PCR/GEX history from Supabase
10. sidebar (timeframe, expiry, toggles)
11. DhanAPI(access_token, client_id)
12. fetch candles → publish _last_df
13. pivots · VOB · POC · swings · money flow
14. analyze_option_chain()  → publish _cached_option_data   ★
15. leg fetches (ATM±3 CE/PE) → _atm_leg_dfs, _atm_leg_vob_volume, …
16. compute_composite_bias · compute_market_picture → _market_picture
17. build_reaction_sr → _reaction_sr
18. ══ _mios_pass() ══             ← CALLED HERE   ★★
19. fill _v6_container, _v5_container (dashboards)
20. option-chain panels, charts, alerts
21. save_app_state() (throttled 300s)
```

## 4.3 · ★★ The bug this order exists to prevent

`_mios_pass()` used to be called at step 8, where it was defined. The comment
at `vob_minimal.py:28117` records what happened:

> MIOS fetches nothing of its own — it reads the caches this function fills.
> Running it at this point read every one of them from the **PREVIOUS** cycle,
> because `_cached_option_data` is not published until the chain block far
> below. That is why spot price and everything derived from it sat still while
> the foundation panels underneath were live.

The fix: define the closure early, **call it after step 17**, and render the
dashboards into containers reserved at step 4 so the page layout is unchanged.

**If you add an engine that needs a new cache, publish the cache before step
18 or your engine reads last cycle's data — silently.**

## 4.4 · What `_mios_pass()` does

```
build_htf_profiles()          Stage 45 HTF refresh (cached per bar close)
    ↓
_is_expiry_today flag         the chain is the only place that knows
    ↓
run_mios_pass(session_state, db)      ← the orchestrator, 47 engines
    ↓
log_event_impact(db, state)           Stage 33 → Supabase
    ↓
build_mios_decision_and_log(db, …)    Decision v0 → mios_decisions
    ↓
advance_explainability(state)         Stages 65/67 narration + WAIT log
    ↓
manage_signal_lifecycle(db, dec, spot)  A/A+ decisions → trade_signals
    ↓
MIOS_BRIEFINGS (OFF by default)       Evolution shifts → Discord
```

# Part 5 — Generation 1: the native app

This is the original application, written before MIOS existed. **It is still
the only thing that fires a live alert or arms a trade.**

## 5.1 · `compute_market_picture` (line 14399)

The native bias engine. Produces `regime` ∈ {UP, DOWN, SIDEWAYS} plus
`p_up` / `p_down` / `p_side` percentages.

**Confidence-weighted voting, not a head-count.** Each signal's magnitude
scales the points it contributes, via `_mp_conf(mag, full, floor=0.35)`:

| Weight | Signal |
|---|---|
| Full | CE↔PE alignment · leg FAST net · VWAP · ATM chain · ΔOI |
| Reduced | GEX · DEX · IV skew · global · news · commodity |

The docstring explains why: *"This stops a pile of marginal secondary signals
from outvoting the strong primary ones — which is what let the banner disagree
with the MIOS V5 conflict read."*

It also produces `entry_gate`, `liq_pools`, `oi_floor`, `oi_ceiling`, `vwap`.

## 5.2 · The Entry Gate (line 14874)

The live decision path. States:

| State | Meaning | Trade Card renders |
|---|---|---|
| `CALL` / `PUT` | Zone tested **and** reclaimed | 🟢/🔴 **ENTER** |
| `ARMED_CALL` / `ARMED_PUT` | At the zone, awaiting confirmation candle | 🟡 **GET READY** |
| `AT_ZONE_WAIT` / `CHOP_WAIT` / `NO_ROOM` / `REVERSED` | At a zone, not clean | 👀 **WATCHING** |
| `PINNED` | Magnet-locked at an OI pin | 🧲 **PINNED** |
| `WAIT` | Mid-range | ⏳ **WAIT** |

Supporting machinery: `_GatePinned`, `_snap_level_to_swing`,
`_detect_liquidity_pools`, `_candle_sweep_reclaim`, `_zone_confirmed`.

## 5.3 · The other native engines

| Function | What it does |
|---|---|
| `compute_composite_bias` (13188) | 982-line multi-factor bias — pure computation |
| `build_reaction_sr` (11945) | **The canonical S/R object** → `_reaction_sr` |
| `enrich_zone_intel` (12452) | Attaches the Zone Intelligence card (origin ★, lifecycle, health, odds) |
| `compute_full_market_read` (20130) | Per-leg normalised factor scoring |
| `generate_master_signal` (9823) | The legacy 651-line master signal |
| `analyze_strike_activity` (7669) | Capping / decapping / wall detection |
| `compute_leg_entry_decisions` (21389) | Per-strike CE/PE entry logic |
| CIE / CMCE / IOFCE (3779–4941) | Candlestick · Cross-market · Institutional order flow |

## 5.4 · The Guardian

When `_entry_gate_active` is set, `_guard_state` grades the open trade every
cycle:

| State | Trade Card |
|---|---|
| `EXIT` | ⚡ **EXIT FAST — reversal confirmed** |
| `WARNING` | ⚠️ **WATCH — sudden opposite flow** |
| `PATIENT` | 🧘 **HOLD PATIENT — normal noise, don't panic-exit** |
| — | ✅ **ON TRACK — let it work** |

The guard state is only honoured if `time.time() - _gs['ts'] <= 60` — a stale
guard reading is discarded rather than shown.

---

# Part 6 — MIOS V5: the computation layer

> **V5 computes. V6 interprets.** — the governing principle.

## 6.1 · The contract (`mios_v5/core/contract.py`)

Every engine returns the same `EngineResult`:

```python
EngineResult(
    engine, stage, status, bias, confidence,
    evidence, risks, opportunities,
    data,                    # engine-specific payload
    provenance,              # source + tier + freshness
    errors, runtime_ms,
)
```

### The enums

```python
Bias    STRONG_BULL · BULL · NEUTRAL · BEAR · STRONG_BEAR · SIDEWAYS · NONE
Status  OK · NEUTRAL · DEGRADED · ERROR · DISABLED
Severity INFO · WARNING · ERROR · CRITICAL
ErrorType MISSING_API · MISSING_DATA · FAILED_FORMULA · TIMEOUT ·
          INVALID_CALCULATION · DATA_LIMIT · STALE_DATA
Tier    1 EXECUTED · 2 DERIVED · 3 RESTING
```

`Bias.NEUTRAL` ≠ `Bias.NONE`. NEUTRAL means *balanced*; NONE means *this
engine does not produce a direction*.

### The five hard rules

1. **Never fabricate.** Cannot compute → `NEUTRAL` **with a reason**.
2. **Structured errors.** Every failure is a row in `engine_errors`.
3. **Data-limits are not alarms.** Structurally impossible → `DISABLED` +
   `DATA_LIMIT` at severity `INFO`. Never lights the monitor red.
4. **No BUY/SELL, ever.** Output is bias + confidence + evidence + risks +
   levels + invalidation. *The trader decides.*
5. **Degrade, don't vanish.** A crashing engine yields a structured `ERROR`
   result; the pipeline continues.

## 6.2 · The orchestrator

```
MarketState (shared blackboard)
      ↓
Orchestrator ── topological order ──► Engine 0 … Engine 69
      ↓                                 each → EngineResult into MarketState
RunReport ──► Stage 0 Health score
```

- **Kahn's algorithm** topo-sort, stable-sorted by `(stage, name)` so
  equal-rank engines always run in spec order
- **Cycles raise at registration time**, never silently reorder
- **Unknown deps are tolerated** — they resolve to NEUTRAL via `state.require()`
- `health_pct = (ok + 0.5×degraded) / runnable × 100` — **DISABLED engines are
  excluded from the denominator.** They are not failures

It is a **DAG, not a chain**. Stage 35 alone consumes stages 7–11, 25, 31–34.

## 6.3 · The 41 V5 stages

### Layer 1 — Foundation (0–10)

| # | Engine | Key outputs |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | System Health | health score, engine status, errors → Supabase |
| 1 | Data Collection | *folded into the host app's caches* |
| 2 | Market Structure | HH/HL/LH/LL, BOS, CHOCH, order/breaker blocks, FVG |
| 3 | Market Memory | prev day/week/month H/L/close/VWAP/POC/VAH/VAL |
| 4 | Market Context | gap type, expiry/event day, day classification |
| 5 | Market Regime | regime + strength (adapter over `_market_picture`) |
| 6 | Time Cycle | session phase (6 IST blocks) + `confidence_tempered` weight |
| 7–10 | Structure / Levels / Volume Profile / Liquidity | *folded into 2, 17 and native indicators* |

### Layer 2 — Institutional Intelligence (11–20)

| # | Engine | Key outputs |
|---|---|---|
| 11 | Dealer Position | GEX, DEX, Vanna, Charm, flip, pinning, dealer zones |
| 12 | Option Chain | PCR, build-up/unwind, CE/PE walls, ATM bias |
| 13 | Institutional Position | Long/Short Build-up, Unwinding, Covering |
| 14 | Order Flow | CVD/CBV/CSV, delta divergence, absorption |
| 15 | Microstructure | ⛔ **DISABLED** — needs L2 depth |
| 17 | Liquidity | pools + walls |
| 18 | Sector Rotation | leaders/laggards, rotation bias |
| 19 | Global | global sentiment + influence score |
| 20 | Commodity & Macro | risk-on/off, external risk score |

### Layer 3 — AI Fusion (21–30)

| # | Engine | Key outputs |
|---|---|---|
| 21 | News | keyword sentiment over NIFTY/SENSEX headlines |
| 22 | VIX | volatility environment |
| 23 | Flows | FII / DII cash |
| 24 | **Institutional Preparation** | *event-agnostic* coiling detection → the ⚠️ banner |
| 25 | Institutional Intent | smart-money direction |
| 26 | Pattern Alignment | candlestick + chart patterns |

### Layer 4 — Decision Support (31–41)

| # | Engine | Key outputs |
|---|---|---|
| 31 | Probability | breakout/breakdown/bounce/reject % |
| 33 | Event Impact | did the event actually change structure? |
| 34 | Event Explanation | the "why" — **never** the signal |
| 35 | **Reaction Zone ⭐** | battle zone, expected winner, next target, stop |
| 36 | Market Story | plain-language narrative |
| 37 | Market Energy | *promoted to a first-class engine in V6 Wave 3* |
| 38 | Tomorrow Preparation | post-close plan |
| 39 | Pre-Market Update | pre-09:15 brief |
| 40 | Learning | bias-vs-actual, confidence calibration |
| 41 | Final Read | `build_final_read()` — the boundary object |

## 6.4 · Stage 27 — the Conflict Engine

**This produces the number in the Trade Card headline.** It arbitrates ~34
engines by priority × confidence:

```
Dealer > Intent > OrderFlow > Liquidity > Structure > Options > Global > Patterns
```

Output: `preferred_bias` + `confidence` + `conflict_severity`.
`confidence_tempered` applies Stage 6's session conviction weight.

## 6.5 · Stage 41 — `final_read` — the boundary object

`build_final_read(state)` collapses the pipeline into one dict. **This is the
only object V6 reads.** Its ~70 keys include:

```
preferred_bias · confidence · confidence_tempered · conflict_severity
reaction · acceptance · absorption · htf · validity · validity_both
transition · memory_read · market_state · energy_read · flow_shift · stability
families · families_read · decision_v2 · day_classification · session_intel
strong_support · strong_resistance · next_target · battle_zone · invalidation
preparation · event · event_impact · explanation · calendar · probabilities
sections · risks · opportunities · evidence · health_score
```

If you are adding a V6 feature and the data is not in `final_read`, **add it to
`final_read` first**. Reaching into `MarketState` from a V6 module violates
principle 4 (No hidden logic).

# Part 7 — MIOS V6: the intelligence layer

> **V6 must never become a second analytics engine.** It interprets, correlates
> and explains the canonical outputs V5 produces — it never recomputes them.

## 7.1 · Why V6 exists

From `mios_v5/v6_bias.py`:

> V5 arrives at a bias by arbitrating ~34 engines through the Conflict Engine.
> V6 was built because **that count is a lie**: CVD, Money Flow, Delta and VOB
> are the same evidence counted four times, so the V5 tally is loudest exactly
> where it is most correlated.

## 7.2 · The admission rule ⚠️ BINDING

Before any new engine is accepted:

> **Can this be merged into an existing evidence family?**
> **YES → merge it. NO → only then create an engine.**

And it must **increase accuracy · reduce false entries · improve
explainability**. If it does none of those, it does not go in.

🧊 **WAVE 3 IS FROZEN.** No new analytical engines. Any proposal must also
answer: *why can't this be a field on an existing engine?*

## 7.3 · The V6 engines

### Wave 1 — Signal Protection

| # | Engine | Deliverable |
|---|---|---|
| **44** | Sudden Flow Shift + Stability | Reads the **derivative** — CVD swing, OI velocity, gamma repricing, IV jump, volume explosion, price displacement. Owns `STABLE → UNSTABLE → SHOCK → RECOVERY`. **Non-directional** (`Bias.NONE`) — it vetoes, never leans |
| **53** | Evidence Correlation | Groups correlated evidence into **families**, collapses each to one weighted vote. **This lowers some confidences — that is the point** |

### Wave 2 — Entry Intelligence

| # | Engine | Deliverable |
|---|---|---|
| **42** | Acceptance / Rejection / Trap | True/failed breakout · bull/bear trap · liquidity sweep · acceptance · rejection. Merged because *a "failed breakout" **is** a bull trap* — two engines would disagree |
| **45** | Higher-Timeframe VPFR | 1H · 4H · Daily · Weekly · **Monthly · Yearly** VAH/VAL/POC/HVN/LVN + value migration |

### Wave 3 — Market State

| # | Engine | Deliverable |
|---|---|---|
| **37** | Market Energy | state · compression · expansion readiness · release probability |
| **43** | Institutional Absorption | buyer/seller absorption · exhaustion. **Renamed from "Hidden Liquidity"** — iceberg detection needs L2 we do not receive. *Absorption is measurable; icebergs would be fabricated* |
| **47** | Bias Transition | `Bear ↓ Weakening` / `Bull ↑ Strengthening` — extends Evolution from "it flipped" to "it's decaying" |
| **48** | Market State | Trend · Pullback · Rotation · Compression · Expansion · Range · Accumulation · Distribution · Mark Up · Mark Down |
| **50** | LTP Behaviour | "Call exhaustion", "Put building", "Selling pressure increasing" |
| **51** | Signal Validity Filter | Checks 1H/4H/Daily/Weekly agreement before any entry |
| **54** | Market Memory | How long the current state has existed. Feeds 47 and 53 |

### Wave 4 — Decision

| # | Engine | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **46** | Market Control | **not built** |
| **52** | Decision Engine v2 | `WAIT · WATCH · ENTRY READY · ENTER · SCALE IN · HOLD · TRAIL · PARTIAL EXIT · FULL EXIT · ABORT` + adaptive trail |

⚠️ **Gate:** v2 does not go live until Wave 6 shows the v0 gate stack beats the
Entry Gate. *Validate before you weight.*

### Stage 68 — Market Day Classification

📈 Trend · 🔄 Swing · ↔ Range · 🔪 Choppy · ⚡ High Volatility ·
🧲 Expiry Pin · 💥 News Event · 💤 Low Participation

**Confidence is cross-group agreement, not signal count.** Twelve signals from
one group is one opinion repeated twelve times.

**Two types are facts, not votes:** `NEWS_EVENT` (Stage 28 fired) and
`EXPIRY_PIN` (expiry + measurable charm pin) take precedence.

**Style is separate from classification** — `style_caveat` overrides the
guidance without touching the type.

### Stage 69 — Market Session Intelligence

Eight windows: Pre-Open · Opening Auction · Opening Drive · Morning Trend ·
Midday Balance · Afternoon Trend · Closing · Closed.

> ⛔ **`SESSION_AWARE = False`.** The modifiers are computed, published and
> logged every cycle — **and applied by nobody.** `modifier_for()` returns `{}`
> while the switch is off, so the gate cannot be bypassed by reading
> `applies_to`.

Two modifiers move in **opposite** directions by design: Stage 44's spike
sensitivity is ×0.6 in the Opening Drive (opening spikes are normal) and ×1.4
at Midday (a spike in a quiet tape is meaningful).

## 7.4 · The V6 bias (`mios_v5/v6_bias.py`)

### Four voters

| Weight | Voter | Stage |
|---|---|---|
| **3.0** | Evidence families (de-duplicated) | 53 |
| **2.5** | Reaction at level | 42 |
| **2.0** | HTF alignment | 45 |
| **1.5** | Institutional absorption | 43 |

Stage 42 is weighted second **on purpose**: everything else is inference about
what price *should* do; a rejection or confirmed breakdown **has already
occurred**. *Executed evidence outranks derived evidence.*

### Four modifiers — which never vote

| Stage | Effect |
|---|---|
| 47 transition | ×0.55 … ×1.10 (→ ×0.6 when it points **against** the read) |
| 54 memory | ×0.80 … ×1.05 on state maturity |
| 51 validity | **caps** confidence |
| 44 flow shift | **hard cap** — the tape changed |

Stage 47 is excluded from voting because *its bias is derived from Stage 53's
families* — letting it vote would count the family read twice and inflate
confidence precisely when families are already unanimous.

51 and 44 **cap rather than scale**, because *"a gate that merely discounted a
read would let a strong-enough score walk through a veto."*

### The arithmetic

```python
w      = WEIGHTS[key] × max(0.25, confidence/100)
ratio  = (bull_w − bear_w) / total_w
bias   = band(ratio)        # ±0.60 → STRONG, ±0.15 → directional
coverage = len(voters) / 4
conf   = |ratio| × 100 × (0.6 + 0.4 × coverage)     # ← three voters ≠ four
conf  ×= each modifier
conf   = min(conf, gates.cap)
conf   = clamp(0, 97)
if bias == NEUTRAL: conf = min(conf, 40)
```

### Divergence is the deliverable

`compare()` returns V5 and V6 side by side. `_divergence()` writes a specific
sentence per disagreement shape:

| Shape | Sentence |
|---|---|
| V5 directional, V6 flat | *"V6 sees no clean edge where V5 does — the V5 read is likely correlated evidence counted more than once."* |
| V6 directional, V5 flat | *"V6 finds a directional read V5 calls flat — usually the reaction at the level, which V5 does not weight."* |
| **Opposite** | *"treat this as a stand-aside, not as a choice between two opinions."* |

⚠️ The middle sentence names the reaction voter generically. On a card where
Stage 42 reads `Watching 0%`, reaction is **not** one of the voters (it returns
`None` with no winner) — so the explanation points at the wrong voter. Read the
voter list, not the sentence.

## 7.5 · V6.5 — Explainability (Stages 61–67)

**No new trading logic and no new engines.**

| # | Module | Deliverable |
|---|---|---|
| 61 | `explain_decision.py` | Why BUY/SELL/WAIT/EXIT. **No generic explanations** — every ✓/✗ is built *from* an engine read and carries that engine's name |
| 62 | *(same module)* | WAIT analysis. Same module because *"why did you act"* and *"why didn't you"* have the same answer shape; split, they would drift |
| 63 | `checklist.py` | Nine weighted conditions. **Three states:** ✅ met · ❌ not met · ⚪ **could not report**. Unknowns are excluded from readiness, not guessed |
| 64 | `risk_explain.py` | Entry/stop/target/trail reasoning, labelled **proven vs derived** |
| 65 | `narrator.py` | Written **on transitions only** — a narrator that prints every cycle gets ignored within a day |
| 66 | `trade_review.py` | Winners reviewed too: +50 of a +55 run and +50 of a +200 run are the same P&L and completely different work |
| 67 | `daily_summary.py` | **What MIOS refused is half the report** |

## 7.6 · Wave 6 — Learning (Stages 55–60)

| # | Module | Deliverable |
|---|---|---|
| 55 | `attribution.py` | **One row per engine per trade** — without it there is only a blended win rate that cannot say *which* engine to fix |
| 56 | `engine_accuracy.py` | **Abstention is not a vote.** Small samples labelled, not hidden (Wilson interval) |
| 57 | `calibration.py` | *"Claims 90%, delivers 52%."* Brier score |
| 58 | `threshold_opt.py` | Reports **the winners a filter would have cost** as prominently as the losers it avoids |
| 59 | `contribution.py` | **Shapley values, not correlation** — correlation rewards the redundant engine and punishes the pivotal one |
| 60 | `false_signal.py` | Names **the engine that called it right and was outvoted** |

> ⛔ **BINDING.** The Learning Engine may only **observe · measure · explain ·
> recommend · validate**. It never influences a live decision, never moves a
> threshold or weight, and never hides a poor result. Not in `ALL_ENGINES`,
> exposes no `apply`/`deploy`/`promote` — **asserted by tests**.

## 7.7 · Stage 71 · 71.5 — the Trade Opportunity Matrix

> **An orchestrator, not an engine.** It computes no market fact. 47 engines
> answer *what is happening*; the Decision Engine answers *act or wait*.
> Neither answers what a trader opens the screen with: **where is the best
> opportunity, and over what hold time?**

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `horizon_owner.py` | The ownership registry — pure data |
| `opportunity.py` | Stage 71 — scores and ranks the five horizons |
| `opportunity_intel.py` | Stage 71.5 — what *kind* of trade each one is |
| `ui/opportunity_panel.py` | The Dashboard 2 panel |

Not in `ALL_ENGINES`, no mutators, `advisory_only` throughout — the Stage 70
standing.

### The five horizons

| Horizon | Hold | Owns |
|---|---|---|
| **Scalp** | 5–15 min | 22 producers — `fast` signals + S42/43/50 |
| **Midday** | 1–3 h | 9 — `lag` leaves + S48/69/37 + 1H |
| **Intraday** | today | 10 — S02/11/12/13/14/17/22/51/68 + 4H |
| **Positional** | days | 6 — S18/23/30 + cross-expiry + Daily/Weekly ⚠️ degraded |
| **Swing** | weeks | 5 — S03/19/20 + Monthly/Yearly — **bias + levels only** |

### The ownership registry ⚠️ BINDING

Stage 53 exists because CVD, Money Flow, Delta and VOB were the same evidence
counted four times. A multi-horizon matrix re-creates that failure one level
up — feed one CVD read into scalp *and* midday *and* intraday, and "three
horizons agree" is one signal repeated three times.

`horizon_owner.py` is the table that prevents it. **93 producers, each in
exactly one category:**

| Category | n | Votes? | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `OWNED` | 52 | ✅ once | a leaf directional read |
| `STABILITY` | 3 | ❌ | S44/47/54 — shape Stability + the veto |
| `AGGREGATE` | 15 | ❌ shown | composites; voting would re-count members |
| `EXCLUDED` | 8 | ❌ shown | `mis`-tier noise, or superseded by a stage |
| `NON_DIRECTIONAL` | 15 | ❌ hidden | infrastructure with no bias |

Producers are keyed by **immutable id**, never display name. Engines reuse
`Engine.name` — already the `MarketState.results` key, so it cannot drift from
the pipeline. Natives use `native_*` bridged to their `_BIAS_CATEGORY` label;
a rename breaks the build rather than silently orphaning an owner.

**Supersession** applies principle 1 across generations: where a native signal
and a stage measure the same fact, the stage wins and the native goes to
`EXCLUDED` — which is why `native_atm_pcr` does not vote beside
`stage12_options`.

`STABILITY` is not a new judgement. `v6_bias.py` reached it first: 44 and 54
return `Bias.NONE` by design, and 47's bias derives from Stage 53's families.
Stage 48 stays in `OWNED` because, unlike its neighbours, it has a direction.

### The score is a Wilson lower bound

```python
score = wilson(agreeing, directional).low × coverage    # .low is PERCENT
```

Pools are deliberately uneven, so raw agreement would rank on pool size:

```
same ~80% agreement, different pools
  n=22  18/22 = 81.8%  →  61.5        n= 6   5/6 = 83.3%  →  43.6
  n=10   8/10 = 80.0%  →  49.0        n= 5   4/5 = 80.0%  →  37.6
```

Note row 3 against row 1: **83.3% scores below 81.8%** once sample size
counts. Reuses Stage 56's helper and its rule that small samples are labelled,
not hidden.

⚠️ Quality and Risk multipliers were **deliberately dropped** from the score.
Neither has a universal producer — v0's quality is `None` unless ARMED or
CONFIRMED, and risk needs a stop that positional and swing lack. Defaulting a
missing term to 1.0 asserts a fact nobody measured (principle 9).

### Stage 44 vetoes per horizon, never globally

| Horizon | Effect |
|---|---|
| Scalp · Midday | **veto** — score → 0 |
| Intraday | discount ×0.80 |
| Positional · Swing | ignored |

A flow shift destroys a scalp and can *be* the swing thesis.

### Stage 71.5 — what kind of trade

Nine derived labels per row: **type · quality · lifetime · risk · maturity ·
rotation · timing · confidence breakdown · weakness.**

Governed by Stage 63's rule: **three states, not two** — a value, or `UNKNOWN`
with the reason. Never a default. `Risk: —  (dealer, session and acceptance
silent)` is honest; `Risk: LOW` computed from nothing is not, and it is more
dangerous because it looks like an answer.

- **Quality** reuses `decision.py::_grade` bands exactly (`A+ ≥4.5 · A ≥3.8 ·
  B ≥3.0 · C`) plus `AVOID`. No `B+` — a band v0 cannot express would diverge
  the vocabularies. Unknown components are **excluded**, never scored 0.
- **Lifetime** modulates the horizon's own `HOLD` band — `"5–15 min
  (shorter)"` with the reason. Never a free-floating number.
- **Timing is horizon-scoped.** Scalp/midday/intraday trigger on Stage 42's
  reaction; positional/swing trigger on Stage 45 HTF alignment. Without this,
  swing read `NOW` off a one-minute event.
- **Counter-trend marking.** The type is a market fact shared by every row, so
  a horizon leaning against it renders `Counter-trend (Breakdown)` rather than
  a contradiction.
- **Rotation** takes `previous` as a parameter and is `UNKNOWN` on cycle one.

### The panel

Header + one row per horizon always visible (~9 KB); reasoning, breakdown and
excluded list behind expanders (~33 KB). Sits at the top of the Trading tab —
the three context strips that used to precede the chart moved **below** it, so
execution stays above the fold.

### Stage 71.7 — Premium Energy & Spike

`premium_energy.py` · `ui/premium_energy_panel.py`

Stage 71 says *which horizon and which side*. 71.7 says **whether that premium
is actually being traded, and whether it could expand violently.** Advisory,
absent from `ALL_ENGINES`, and it never says buy or sell.

**Energy is not Spike.** Energy is participation *now*; Spike is expansion
*probability*. A premium grinding higher is high Energy, low Spike; one pinned
under a dealer wall is moderate Energy, high Spike. They are built from
different substrates on purpose — merging them is the tempting refactor and it
destroys the point.

**Each side is scored alone, never by subtraction.** `call 70, put 65` is two
live premiums; `70 − 65 = 5` says "no edge", which is false. Dominance and
Balance are *presentations* of the two scores, never sources.

| Input | Owner |
|---|---|
| **CBV · CSV · CVD** — mandatory, per side, as **numbers** | `indicators/order_flow.totals` via `_atm_leg_ltf_delta` |
| Leg direction (six glyph engines) | `_leg_bias_cache` |
| Premium behaviour — building · distribution · squeeze · unwinding · absorbing · exhausted | **Stage 50**, read whole |
| Reaction — acceptance · break · trap · sweep | **Stage 42**, routed to the side it favours |
| Dealer Wall · Gamma Flip | **Stage 11** via `fr["dealer_levels"]` |
| Compression · release · expansion readiness | **Stage 37** |
| Stability | **Stage 71**'s `stability()` over 44/47/54 |

⚠️ **Stage 44 reaches the output through Stability and nothing else.** It used
to cap Spike as well, which counted one veto twice — Stage 71's `stability()`
already consumes `freeze_entries`. A source-level test now fails the build if
the freeze reappears in the Spike path.

**Two numbers cap rather than average.** *Participation* caps Spike — a premium
nobody trades cannot expand explosively, however coiled the tape is. *Relative
volume* caps Energy — `buy_share` describes the book, not the size, so 0.1M
split evenly would otherwise score like 27M split evenly.

**Vocabularies are borrowed, never translated.** Energy bands are
`Dead · Weak · Healthy · Strong · Explosive`; Stability reports **Stage 44's own
four words**; Confidence reuses `decision._grade`, imported so this stage and
the Decision Engine cannot print disagreeing letters.

**Energy Shift has seven states**, not six:

`Exploding · Increasing · Building · Holding · Compressing · Distributing · Decreasing`

`Holding` is a reading, not a fallback. Energy that exists and is not changing
is a different fact from energy that is *coiling* — compression is a structure
Stage 37 measures, and "nothing moved" is not evidence of one. Where Stage 50
names a structural state that agrees with the movement, its word wins, because
it names the mechanism: `Distributing` says writers are selling into this
premium where `Decreasing` only says the number fell.

**Acceleration is reported beside the state**, because either alone misleads —
`Increasing` says nothing about whether the rise is 6 points or 26, and `+18`
says nothing about what produced it. A second reading, `accelerating`, says
whether the change itself is growing; it needs a third cycle (two points
describe a change, three are the fewest that describe a change *in* the change)
and stays `UNKNOWN` until then. Magnitude is compared, not sign — a fall going
from −4 to −15 is speeding up in the sense a trader means.

```
cycle 1   energy  29 Weak       UNKNOWN     accel  —
cycle 2   energy  89 Explosive  Exploding   accel +60
cycle 3   energy 100 Explosive  Building    accel +11   slowing
```

Cycle 3 is why the two numbers are separate: energy is at its ceiling and the
move into it has nearly stopped.

**One trigger, not three.** `TRIGGER_PRIORITY` is causal — a dealer wall giving
way changes what every other read means, so a volume spike underneath it is a
consequence, not a second finding. `top_reasons` carries up to five contributors
as `{code, label, side, weight}`: codes a downstream stage branches on, not
sentences it would have to parse.

**Rotation measures energy migration**, not which side the matrix currently
favours. Stage 71's side can flip on directional evidence while both premiums
keep exactly the participation they had, and calling that rotation names a
migration that never happened.

**The horizon join is the point, and it is not in the spec.**
`attach_to_horizons()` flags `scalp → PUT · energy 21 → CONTRADICTED` — a
horizon ranking high on directional evidence whose option has no participation.
Nothing else on the screen can say it.

### Stage 71.8 — Premium Strike Selection & Validation

`strike_validation.py` · `ui/strike_validation_panel.py`

Answers **"is the premium I want to trade actually a good premium?"** — not
*CALL or PUT*, which 71.7 answered and this stage reads.

```
71.7   which side has energy?          → Preferred Premium
71.8   is this strike worth trading?   → Overall Strike Score   ← here
72     can I enter now?                → not built
```

**The trader picks the strike; the stage grades it.** `selected` is a
parameter, and disagreement with what the chain is actually trading is
**reported, never corrected**. There is no mechanism to switch a strike and the
stage is not permitted one: a validator that silently moves the thing it is
validating is not a validator. `most_traded_agreement` is the whole of that
report — `Agree` on the busiest strike, `Partially Agree` within one step,
`Disagree` beyond. One step is `Partially Agree` because the adjacent strike is
routinely right for delta reasons, and calling that a disagreement trains a
trader to ignore the check.

**Busiest means volume, not OI.** OI is what is *held*; volume is what is being
*traded today*. A strike can carry huge OI from a position opened last week and
trade nothing this morning, and it is this morning's liquidity that decides
whether you get out. When the chain omits volume the OI fallback is **labelled**.

Ten weighted checks, each `Agree · Partially Agree · Disagree` or `UNKNOWN`:

| Check | Weight | Owner |
|---|---|---|
| Liquidity | 2.5 | Stage 12 chain |
| Premium health | 2.0 | **Stage 71.7** |
| Premium S/R | 1.5 | native premium S/R (the leg's own VOB levels) |
| Most-traded | 1.5 | Stage 12 chain |
| Dealer | 1.5 | Stage 11 wall · gamma flip · charm pin |
| Behaviour · Acceptance · HTF · Reaction zone · Absorption | 1.0 each | Stages 50 · 42 · 45 · 35 · 43 |

Liquidity leads because it is the only check that can make a *correct* read
untradeable — every other one is an opinion about a fill you may not get. A
`Disagree` there is **disqualifying**: it returns `Avoid` regardless of score,
because ten agreeing opinions about direction cannot rescue a premium nobody is
quoting.

**Unknown checks leave the denominator, never score zero** (Stage 63's rule),
and `reporting` travels with the score everywhere it goes. Fewer than three
checks reporting is also `Avoid` — a five-star rating resting on two inputs is
the exact failure this stack exists to prevent.

Score → `★★★★★ ≥80 · ★★★★☆ ≥65 · ★★★☆☆ ≥50 · ★★☆☆☆ ≥35 · ★☆☆☆☆ ≥20`, with
`Avoid` a separate verdict rather than the bottom band.

**It absorbed the Premium S/R Analyzer** an earlier draft numbered 71.9: "is
this premium holding its own levels" is one of the questions "is this strike
worth trading" is made of, and splitting them would give two stages a claim on
the same leg.

#### Premium Structure — the one premium-analysis orchestrator

`premium_structure.py` · audited in
`docs/AUDIT_STAGE_71_8_PREMIUM_STRUCTURE.md` **before it was written**.

That audit checked 23 Premium Structure requirements against the codebase and
found **18 already existing**. The dominant finding was not absence but
**discard**: `build_leg_bias_table` runs the per-leg engines every cycle and
collapses each to one 🟢/🔴/⚪ glyph. `detect_ignition` returns *named*
sub-signals — **Wyckoff Spring** and **Wyckoff Upthrust** among them, which are
false-break-plus-snap-back and therefore *are* the fakeout evidence — and the
leg table keeps only `bull`/`bear`/`neu`.

So the module reads the engines, not their glyphs. It **consumes** support ·
resistance · acceptance · rejection · VOB · trend · momentum · CBV · CSV · CVD ·
POC · value area · absorption · ignition, each with its owner named in
`CONSUMED`.

It **computes eight things**, each argued for individually in §5 of the audit
and listed in `COMPUTED_HERE`:

| New | Why |
|---|---|
| **HVN · LVN** | the profile publishes bins with volume ratios; nothing labelled which are nodes. Thresholds are expressed against the **even share**, so they do not change meaning when the bin count does |
| **RVOL** | `avg_vol_1m` was computed in two places and discarded in both |
| **Volume Climax** | genuinely missing — and needs RVOL, which did not exist. **Three conditions, all required**: high RVOL *plus* a wide range *plus* a close rejecting its own extreme. Volume alone is participation; a high bar in a trend is the trend working |
| **Break · Fakeout probability** | weighted reads over the evidence above, **scored separately** — a break on climax volume with a Wyckoff upthrust is genuinely likely to go *and* genuinely likely to fail, and one blended number hides exactly that |
| **structure_score · confidence** | the orchestrator's own output; no other owner by definition |

⚠️ The audit found **four POC implementations** (`compute_vpfr` ·
`money_flow_profile` · `TriplePOC` · `compute_dynamic_poc`). **`compute_vpfr` is
the chosen owner** — already published per leg, returns VAH/VAL alongside, and
the HTF stack uses it, so a premium POC and an index POC are computed the same
way. A fifth is forbidden and **a test asserts the module imports no profile
builder at all**.

Score and confidence are separate readings: a premium scoring 80 on two
components and one scoring 80 on six are not the same finding. A high fakeout
probability **caps** the score rather than averaging into it — reliability is a
statement *about* the structure, the same veto shape Stage 71.7 uses for
participation.

> Stage 71.8's `premium_sr_strength` check now **converts** this score into an
> agreement instead of grading `sr["state"]` itself. Two modules owning "what is
> this premium's structure doing" was the duplication Premium Structure exists
> to end, and `LOW` confidence cannot read `Agree` — a strong score on two
> components is not a strong structure.

**Phase 5 · overlays.** Premium support · resistance · POC · HVN · LVN go on the
terminal chart that already exists, through `_leg_overlay`, which already drew
the leg's own levels. No second chart. The structure is built **once** per cycle
and consumed by both the validation and the chart.

**Phase 6 · the CALL/PUT summary** sits in the per-side validation card rather
than the six-card Command Center for an ordering reason: the Command Center
renders *before* the strike picker, so the structure does not exist yet when
those cards are built. Putting it there would need a reorder or last cycle's
numbers.

> ⛔ No BUY · SELL · ENTER · EXIT. Asserted over the stage's **output** across a
> matrix of inputs, not by grepping the source — Stage 43 publishes

**The picker** offers ATM±3 from `_cockpit_ctx`, so it can only name strikes the
app can fetch candles for. The selection lives in `session_state` and survives
reruns; a stored strike that drifts outside the window falls back to ATM rather
than validating against candles the app no longer has. A wing strike with no leg
entry reports `UNKNOWN` S/R rather than borrowing the ATM's — substituting a
neighbour would grade the wrong option with nothing on screen to say so.

⚪ **Not persisted to Supabase.** The app publishes a session snapshot to
`vob_app_state` every minute, but `_selected_strikes` is not among the
`_PERSIST_KEYS` it carries — a selection survives reruns, not a restart.
Declared rather than half-built.

### Stage 71.85 — Premium LTP Behaviour

`premium_behaviour.py` · `docs/AUDIT_STAGE_71_85_PREMIUM_BEHAVIOUR.md` ·
`docs/STAGE71_85_OUTPUT_CONTRACT.md`

**One question:** *what is the selected premium's LTP doing right now at its own
Support / Resistance?* Not where the levels are — Stage 71.8 owns that. Not
whether to act — Stage 72 owns that. This stage sits between them and describes
the interaction.

```
71.7 Energy → 71.8 Structure → 71.85 Behaviour → 71.95 Context → 72 Entry
```

#### One ledger, one axis, one behaviour

The evidence does not vote for four behaviours. It votes on a single axis —
pressure on **this** premium, `UP` or `DOWN` — and the engaged level turns the
winner into a state:

| engaged level | `UP` wins | `DOWN` wins |
|---|---|---|
| support | `Support Building` | `Support Fading` |
| resistance | `Resistance Fading` | `Resistance Building` |

Plus `Acceptance` (no level engaged, premium holding its value area) and
`Neutral` (the evidence did not agree). Exactly six, exactly one emitted. A
blend is *impossible* here rather than merely forbidden: one winner, one axis,
and the level decides what to call it.

A level is engaged within **4%** of the LTP — premiums move several percent in a
minute, so a band tight enough for a NIFTY level would report "no battle" during
the fight. The nearer level wins; a tie in the ledger is `Neutral`.

The same number can mean opposite things: a high **break probability** at
support is `DOWN`, at resistance is `UP`. That is why it cannot be read without
knowing which level is engaged, and why those votes are cast after engagement.

#### It computes five things, and only five

`behaviour · strength · confidence · momentum · reason ranking`. Everything else
is transported and `CONSUMED` names the owner. The audit checked 30-odd inputs
against the codebase before a line was written: **every one already existed.**

* **Strength** — five stars, the winner's share of the reported evidence.
* **Confidence** — `decision._grade`, **imported, not reimplemented**: agreement
  and coverage averaged on the 1–5 scale `_grade` already speaks, then capped by
  Stage 44 (`SHOCK` → ≤2.0). A second A+/A/B/C ladder would drift from the first
  within a month.
* **Momentum** — five words, from Stage 71.7's shift. `Compressing` maps to
  `Holding` because coiled energy is stored, not spent. **Exhaustion outranks
  everything**: a premium can read accelerating on the shift and still be spent,
  and the spent reading is the one that costs money.
* **Reasons** — at most five, never plain strings, each carrying `code · label ·
  owner · weight · source · direction`. Dissenting rows are shown too, so a
  55/45 read does not render as 100/0.

#### `Neutral` is a verdict; `UNKNOWN` is an absence

`Neutral` means the evidence reported and did not agree. It is one of the six
and it ships with reasons. But its **strength and confidence are `UNKNOWN`** —
five stars and an A+ on "not enough evidence to say" is the opposite of what the
words mean. In Stage 72 it maps to `None`, so it *leaves the denominator* rather
than scoring 50 and quietly holding the score up.

#### Three ownership corrections

The spec lists CBV/CSV/CVD, RVOL and Volume under Stage 71.7. **RVOL and Volume
are Stage 71.8's** — `premium_structure` computes RVOL and 71.7 has none — and
71.8 owns the numeric flow totals where 71.7 has only the per-side glyph. All
five are read from 71.8. Reading flow from one stage and volume from another
would give one leg's tape two owners.

And the **value area is the premium's own**, not Stage 45's: Stage 45's VAH/VAL
are NIFTY levels, and a premium accepted above its own VAH is a different fact —
the one describing the option a trader is holding.

#### One premium at a time ⚠️ BINDING

`analyse()` takes **one** structure and a side. `build()` calls it twice with
nothing shared. Never averaged, never subtracted, never compared — a test
changes every PUT input and asserts the CALL read is byte-identical.

> ⛔ No BUY · SELL · ENTER · EXIT · no CALL/PUT recommendation · never changes
> the selected strike · never overrides Stage 72 · never recalculates Structure,
> S/R, break or fakeout. Enforced on the **parse tree**, docstrings stripped —
> `BUYER_ABSORPTION` is Stage 43's name for a measurement and must survive,
> a bare `BUY` must not.

**The panel is mandatory.** `premium.behaviour` is an eleventh weight in Stage
72 as of contract `72.1`, so it moves decisions — and Principle 12 says a value
that moves decisions must be inspectable somewhere.

### Stage 71.95 — the Unified Trading Context

`trading_context.py` · not an engine · no UI · no session_state · no network

**One immutable object carrying every analysis result a trading decision needs,
so Stage 72 reads one thing instead of thirty.**

```
Market  →  TradingContext  →  Stage 72  →  Trade Manager  →  Telegram
```

Without it, Stage 72 would read `final_read`, the Opportunity Matrix, Stage
71.7, Stage 71.8, Premium Structure and a dozen `sections.*` nodes directly —
duplicated reads, versions drifting inside one cycle, ordering dependencies
nobody wrote down, and a decision whose inputs cannot be listed.

#### Every field names its owner ⚠️ BINDING

Principle 12 says nothing may influence a decision unless the trader can inspect
that exact value. **A value with no owner cannot be inspected, because nobody
knows where to look.** So a field is not a value here — it is a `Field` carrying
`value · owner · stage · source`, where `source` is the **literal dotted path**
`_get()` read. The path is live, not documentation: a source that goes stale
yields `UNKNOWN` rather than a wrong number read from somewhere else.

`ctx.owners()` prints the whole table — 37 fields across seven groups, each with
its stage and path.

#### One fact, one owner

Two fields may read the same *object* for different facts — `market.stability`
and `risk.freeze` are both Stage 44 — but **no two fields may read the same
path**, and a test enforces it. Two names for one fact drift.

Where the spec asks for a field that *is* another field's value, `ALIAS` records
a **pointer** instead of a copy. `risk.recovery` is the example: `RECOVERY` is
one of the four values `market.stability` takes, so reading it separately would
give one fact two owners. It renders `UNKNOWN` with `source =
"→ market.stability"` and the reason.

| Group | Fields |
|---|---|
| **market** | market_state · market_phase · day_type · session · trend · transition · stability |
| **opportunity** | best_horizon · best_side · opportunity_score · confidence · top_reason |
| **premium** | selected_call · selected_put · preferred_premium · premium_structure · premium_score · premium_confidence · premium_ltp · **behaviour · behaviour_strength · behaviour_confidence · momentum · break_probability · fakeout_probability · acceptance · top_reason · structure_state · structure_strength** *(71.85)* |
| **strike** | selected_strike · validation · liquidity · agreement |
| **energy** | energy · dominance · rotation · shift · energy_acceleration · spike_probability |
| **htf** | htf_bias · migration · alignment · structure |
| **risk** | risk · validity · freeze · shock · *(recovery → alias)* |
| **meta** | timestamp · cycle · version · roots supplied/missing · field count |

#### Immutable after creation

**Deep-frozen** — mappings become `MappingProxyType`, sequences become tuples,
all the way down. Shallow immutability would be a promise the object cannot
keep: a frozen dataclass holding a plain dict lets one consumer edit what
another is about to read. Mutating a source *after* `build()` does not change
the context, so two stages reading it in one cycle see one set of values.

#### Missing stays UNKNOWN

Never `0`, never a default — a zero looks like a measurement. `None` is
propagated as `UNKNOWN` too, because engines publish `None` deliberately and a
context must not pass it on as though something were measured. An absent root is
**named** in `meta.roots_missing` rather than read as empty, and `coverage()`
reports how much of the context this cycle actually filled.

#### Where it is built

At the **end** of the strike-validation pass — the last point where all six
roots exist (`final_read`, matrix, 71.7, 71.8, the structures, 71.85). Building it
earlier would freeze a context missing half its fields. Nothing renders it; it
exists to be consumed.

> ⛔ Never calculates · never infers · never averages · never mutates · never
> stores state. Not in `ALL_ENGINES`, imports no producer and no network client
> — asserted on the **import graph**, because the ownership table legitimately
> *names* every producer it carries a value from and a grep cannot tell a label
> from an import.

### Stage 72 — the Entry Engine

`entry_engine.py` · `docs/AUDIT_STAGE_72_ENTRY_ENGINE.md` ·
`docs/STAGE72_OUTPUT_CONTRACT.md`

The **first execution stage**. `EntryEngine(ctx).run()` — one argument, one
frozen `EntryDecision`. It answers only *is there an executable trade right
now*; direction, strike and premium energy were answered upstream and are read,
not re-decided.

It imports **two** local modules — `trading_context` and `decision_v2` — and a
test asserts exactly that set. It cannot reach Stage 42, the Opportunity Matrix
or Premium Structure, which is the entire value of the bridge.

**The state machine is Stage 52's, imported and enforced.** `_checked()` raises
if Stage 72 ever emits a state outside `decision_v2.STATES`. The specification
named three states Stage 52 does not implement — `WATCH`, `PARTIAL_EXIT`,
`FULL_EXIT` — and `SPEC_ALIAS` maps them to `WAIT`, `SCALE_OUT` and `EXIT`
rather than inventing them. In practice it emits only the four pre-entry states
(`WAIT · ENTRY_READY · ENTER · ABORT`); the rest describe an open position it
has no input for.

Ten phases, four of which compute anything — and all four compute over verdicts
the context already carries:

| Phase | Output | Note |
|---|---|---|
| 1 Readiness | `READY · NOT_READY · UNKNOWN` | freeze, shock, invalid strike and illiquidity are **gates**, checked before the score |
| 2 Score | 0–100 | ten documented weights; **strike validation leads at 2.5** — a correct read on an unvalidated strike is the failure being right cannot fix. Unknown inputs leave the denominator |
| 3 Entry zone | `Early · Optimal · Late · Missed` | table over Stage 42's reaction and Stage 71.5's timing; where they disagree the **later** wins |
| 4 Risk | five bands | Stage 71.5's level, **escalated** by instability rather than averaged |
| 5 Reward | four bands | execution quality, not a price forecast |
| 6 Entry type | six types | mapped from Stage 71.5; a type it cannot source stays `UNKNOWN` |
| 7 Package | entry · stop · targets · R:R | ⚠️ **`target2`/`target3` are permanently `UNKNOWN`** — Stage 35 publishes one target and a ladder would be inventing levels |
| 8 Telegram | payload | **prepared, never sent.** No network client is importable; `sent: False` |
| 9 Explainability | ≤5 reasons · trigger · warnings · invalidations | each reason carries the **context's own** `owner` and `source`, copied not written |
| 10 Summary | `trade? why? why not?` | both are present on every decision — a stage that explains itself only when it acts teaches a trader to read silence as permission |

**The audit changed the context, not the engine.** `TradingContext` as first
built could not answer Phases 3, 6 or 7 — Stage 42's reaction, Stage 71.5's
timing/type/quality/risk/lifetime and Stage 35's target/invalidation were not in
it. Ten fields were **added to the context** rather than letting Stage 72 reach
around it. `opportunity.trade_risk` is named apart from `risk.risk` because they
are different facts with different owners: the tape's breakout risk and this
horizon's trade risk.

Every decision records `context_version`, `context_cycle` and
`context_coverage`, so a decision made on a thin cycle is visibly thin, and the
score can be recomputed by hand from the published weights and components.

#### ❄️ FROZEN at `72.1`

`docs/STAGE72_FROZEN.md` is the closed contract. Entry scoring, weights, gates,
recommendation logic, the Telegram decision and `TradingContext` ownership do
not change inside this stage — bug fixes only. Everything else is Stage 73+.

**Amendment 1 (`72.0` → `72.1`)** added Stage 71.85's behaviour as an eleventh
weight, plus one decision field and seven payload keys. The scoring *philosophy*
is untouched — same weighted mean, same unknown-excluded denominator, same
gates, and `premium.premium_score` still weighs 1.5. The dispatcher accepts
**both** versions, so a stored `72.0` decision still replays against the shape
it was written for. A freeze that can be edited without a version bump is not a
freeze; a freeze that can never change is a museum. The bump is the difference,
and the next amendment follows the same rule.

Every decision carries four identity fields, minted once and never rewritten:

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| `id` | UUID4, unique per decision |
| `version` | `"72.1"` |
| `created_at` | UTC ISO 8601, seconds |
| `hash` | SHA-256 over `id · version · state · confidence · score · created_at` |

The hash covers **identity plus verdict**, deliberately not the whole object: a
digest that changed when a reason's wording changed would make the integrity
check cry wolf until someone stopped reading it. `decision.verify()` returns
`False` for a record altered after the fact — which is what replay, audit and
the learning join need.

**A decision represents history.** Immutability is deep: `targets`, `telegram`,
`metadata` and `metadata["components"]` all reject writes, and `Reason` is
frozen too. A consumer that could edit a decision could rewrite what was
decided, and every row built on it would describe something that never happened.

**Stage 73+ carry `decision.identity()` forward** — they never mint their own id
and never restate the timestamp. Position, PnL, trailing, scaling and exit are
theirs; Stage 72 owns the execution decision and nothing after it, asserted by a
test that no such field exists on the output.

> ⛔ Advisory. Immutable. Sends nothing. Not in `ALL_ENGINES`.

### Stage 72.9 — the Decision Dispatcher

`dispatcher.py` · `sql/031_dispatch_history.sql` ·
`docs/AUDIT_STAGE_72_9_DISPATCHER.md` · `STAGE72_9_OUTPUT_CONTRACT.md` ·
`STAGE72_9_FROZEN_PLAN.md`

**The single gateway between MIOS and the outside world.** Not analysis, not
execution, not lifecycle. It owns one question: *should this decision leave
MIOS?*

```
Stage 72 → Stage 72.9 → Telegram
Stage 73 ────┘  ↑ the only door
```

⚠️ **It owns the gateway, not the socket.** `import requests` inside `mios_v5`
is a named forbidden failure mode, so the **transport is injected** and the app
supplies it. This is stronger than owning the client: a send is impossible
without passing the gates, the stage is unit-testable with no network, and a
test asserts no other `mios_v5` module takes a `transport` parameter. The
`registry` is injected for the same reason — history lives in Supabase and this
module reaches no database.

The gate ladder, in order — and the order matters:

| Rung | Condition | State |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | missing field · bad hash · unsupported version | `BLOCKED` |
| 2 | older than 300 s | `EXPIRED` |
| 3 | hash already dispatched | `DUPLICATE` |
| 4 | a newer decision already went | `SUPERSEDED` |
| 5 | confidence `UNKNOWN` | `WAIT` |
| 6 | not a sendable state or action | `WAIT` |
| 7 | otherwise | `READY` → send |

Validation runs **before** the duplicate check: a duplicate check that ran first
would let an altered record suppress a legitimate one.

**`WAIT` is never broadcast.** It is the engine working correctly, and saying so
every cycle trains the reader to mute the channel — the one outcome a signal
channel cannot survive.

**A transport that raises, returns nothing, or returns something unreadable is
`FAILED`, never `SENT`.** A message assumed delivered is a duplicate waiting to
happen: the next cycle would see the hash recorded and stay quiet.

**Editing beats re-sending.** `sql/031` records `telegram_message_id`, so a
trade going `ENTER → TRAIL → EXIT` updates **one** message instead of posting
three that each read like a new signal. The migration carries a partial unique
index on `(decision_hash) WHERE status = 'SENT'`, so the duplicate guarantee
holds even if two app instances race.

**History is append-only.** A decision that was `READY` and then `SENT` is two
rows, so the record says what happened rather than only where it ended. The
Phase 10 cache is *derived* from it rather than stored twice.

**The claim closes the race.** Reading "have I sent this?" and then sending is
two operations with a gap, and two instances starting together both pass the
check before either sends. `reserve() → send → confirm()/release()` closes it,
and in Supabase the claim *is* the unique index: the `SENT` row is inserted
**before** the message goes out, so a racing instance loses on a violation
rather than on cooperation. Send-then-record would leave a window where a crash
produces a delivered message with no history row — a spurious `FAILED` row is
recoverable, a duplicate alert is not.

`metrics()` and `health()` are **derived from the history on read**, never
accumulated: a counter incremented alongside the rows is a second source of
truth that drifts the first time a write fails halfway. Both are ⛔ **monitoring
only** — a test asserts `run()` never reads them, because a dispatch layer that
throttled itself on its own failure rate would turn an outage into a silence.

> ⛔ The payload's wording is Stage 72's. This stage adds identity and nothing

### Stage 73 — the Trade Lifecycle Engine

`trade_lifecycle.py` · `docs/AUDIT_STAGE_73_LIFECYCLE.md` ·
`docs/STAGE73_OUTPUT_CONTRACT.md` · `docs/STAGE73_FROZEN_PLAN.md`

Owns **life after entry**, and nothing before it.

```
TradingContext → Stage 72 → Stage 73 → Learning · Analytics · Replay
                            ↑ here
```

`TradeLifecycle(decision, ctx).run()` — two inputs, and a test asserts the local
import set is exactly `{entry_engine, trading_context}`. It never decides
whether to enter, and **it never mutates an `EntryDecision`**: a decision is
history, so this stage builds a new record that *references* `decision.id`.

**Its states are its own** — `WAIT_ENTRY · ENTERED · HOLD · ADD · SCALE_OUT ·
TRAIL · EXIT · COMPLETE · ABORT`. Stage 52's machine describes getting *into* a
trade; this one describes being *in* one, and sharing a vocabulary would make
`WAIT` mean two different things one stage apart.

⚠️ **`position_known` is always `UNKNOWN`.** `EntryDecision.state == "ENTER"`
means Stage 72 *concluded* an entry was executable — not that an order was
placed or filled, and nothing in MIOS reports that yet. `intent` carries what
Stage 72 decided as a separate fact; `position_state` and `fill_price` are named
in `MISSING_PRODUCERS` and surfaced in the warnings on every decision. Treating
`ENTER` as "we are in a trade" would have every trail, scale and exit decision
managing a position that may not exist, with output that looked entirely normal.

| Phase | Output |
|---|---|
| 1 Awareness | `intent` + `position_known` — two facts, never conflated |
| 2 Health | six bands over eight weighted context fields; **stability leads at 2.5** — the only input that can invalidate the read the trade was opened on |
| 3 Action | **exactly one** of six, by a priority ladder — an exit trigger cannot be outvoted by good health |
| 4 Trail | a **band**, never a level. `adaptive_trail` is Stage 52's; the stop is consumed from `EntryDecision.stop` and echoed as `metadata.stop_consumed` |
| 5 Scale | `Add · Reduce · Neither` by vote, **never an average** — blending "energy collapsing" with "structure strong" recommends adding to a position losing its exit |
| 6 Exit | first trigger wins. **`Stop Hit` outranks `Shock`** — a stop hit during a shock is still a stop hit, and recording the shock would blame the tape for a level doing its job |
| 7 Summary | `why` and `why_not` on every decision |
| 8 Telegram | prepared, `sent: False` |

Identity mirrors Stage 72: `id` · `decision_id` · `version 73.0` ·
`created_at` · `hash`, with `verify()` and `identity()`. Stage 74+ join on
`decision_id`.

**Deliberately not owned:** position sizing, lot count, PnL, broker integration.
They need capital, risk-per-trade and fills — three inputs that do not exist —
and their absence would otherwise infect every phase. A test asserts no such
field appears on the output.

> ❄️ **Not frozen yet.** `STAGE73_FROZEN_PLAN.md` lists ten criteria; eight

### Who owns what on this tab ⚠️

Two surfaces showing the same number is how a trader ends up with two answers
to one question and no way to tell which is authoritative. Dashboard 2's split:

| Surface | Owns |
|---|---|
| **Opportunity Matrix** | horizon ranking · side · quality · timing · risk · energy · rotation · stability |
| **`_sr_intelligence`** | every S/R level, as a ranked object |
| **Trade Cockpit** | where in the trade life we are (Stage 52) |
| **Slim Trade Card** | market facts (spot · VAL/POC/VAH · gap) · the V5 ‖ V6 divergence |

`ui/trade_card_panel.py` is deliberately **not** the full Trade Card. Bias,
quality and timing are absent because the Matrix owns them *per horizon*, which
is more than one blended verdict; S/R is absent because `_sr_intelligence`
renders it ranked further down; the Stage 52 row is absent because the Cockpit
owns it. Tests assert each of those absences.

It also **cannot** be the full card: `mios_v5` never imports `vob_minimal`, so
`render_clean_card` is out of reach from `mios_v5/ui/` by design. The bias
strip is `bias_compare_html` reused unchanged, so the two cards cannot drift
into disagreeing about what V6 said.

### Premium behaviour on the option panels

Stage 50 knew whether a leg was BUILDING / WRITING / SHORT COVERING / FADING
and the trader had to read a badge. The panels now answer it themselves, and
both renderings are drawings of `indicators/order_flow.py` — the single owner:

| | Answers |
|---|---|
| **bar colour** | who was buying *this minute* |
| **CVD line** | is the premium *still* being accumulated |

Bar height is still volume, so the overlay occupies the footprint it always
did. The CVD line is **scaled into the price extent** rather than given a
second axis — the layout is a rowspan grid with `matches="x"`, and a secondary
y would need adding per panel and keeping out of the shared zoom. Consequence:
**the shape is the signal and the number is meaningless**, so it is never
labelled with one.

⚠️ An unmeasured bar is **grey, not green**. A frame with no volume column
yields no flow at all rather than a balanced one.

### The Trade Cockpit — Stage 52 as a checklist

```
Getting in                    Managing it
 ✓ Waiting — no setup          ✓ Holding
 ✓ Setup identified            – Scaled in      (optional, unknowable)
 ✓ Level confirmed             ◆ Trail active
 ✓ Entry taken                 · Partial exit
                               · Exited  · Complete
```

A view over `decision_v2.STATES`. Two refusals matter:

* **A passed optional step is not ticked.** Stage 52 publishes only the
  *current* state, so at TRAIL there is no way to know whether the trade ever
  scaled in. `–` means *not on the path*; a `✓` would assert a scale-in nobody
  took.
* **ABORT is not a rung.** It arrives at any point, so "step 11 of 12" would
  read as a trade nearly done when the correct read is *stop now*. It replaces
  the ladder rather than advancing it.

A test asserts every `STATES` member is accounted for, so a new state cannot
vanish and look like a skipped rung.

⚠️ `native_reads_from_rows()` reads `_all_bias_rows`, **not** `_leg_bias_cache`
— the former carries all 38 signals with `_dir`. A label with no registered id
is skipped, not guessed.

# Part 8 — The decision engines

## 8.1 · Three verdicts on the same instant

| Engine | Generation | Drives alerts? | Trade Card |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Entry Gate** | 1 (native) | ✅ **YES** | ⏳ WAIT / ENTER / GET READY |
| **Decision v0** | 4 | ❌ logs only | 🎯 Decision: … · gates ✓… |
| **Decision v2** | 4 (Stage 52) | ❌ logs only | checklist strip (hidden while WAIT) |

They can disagree — most often about **where price is**, because the Entry Gate
sides spot against `_market_picture` and v0 sides it against `_reaction_sr`.
Since the Trade Card restructure they render adjacent in the DECISIONS column
so the disagreement is visible.

## 8.2 · Decision v0 — the gate stack

**A stack, not a vote.** The first six decide; the seventh grades.

| # | Gate | Question |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Location** | Is spot *at* a zone? (never mid-range) |
| 2 | **Direction** | Does the MIOS bias agree with the side? |
| 3 | **Zone Health** | Is the level *building*, not *fading*? |
| 4 | **Confirmation** | Candle/flow confirmation — don't chase the first touch |
| 5 | **Risk** | R:R ≥ 1.2, room to target, invalidation defined |
| 6 | **Event / Veto** | Shock · preparation · hard conflict → stand aside |
| 7 | **Quality** | ★1–5 per gate, averaged |

**Quality:** `A+ ≥ 4.5 · A ≥ 3.8 · B ≥ 3.0 · C < 3.0`.
The same direction can be an A+ or a C — *that's how experienced traders
actually think.*

**Veto conditions** (any sets `veto = True` → STAND ASIDE):
shock in progress · institutional preparation · signals conflict sharply.

### Log every rejection

A **rejection** = spot was at a zone (a trade was possible) but a gate blocked
it. Logged with the blocking gate. Without this you can never learn *"the Event
Veto prevented 73% of losing trades."*

## 8.3 · The Signal Lifecycle

```
WAIT_ENTRY ──confirmed──▶ ENTERED ──target──▶ TARGET_HIT   (win)
    │  │                    │      ──stop────▶ STOP_HIT     (loss)
    │  │                    └──eod while open▶ EXPIRED      (open)
    │  └──flip / zone lost──────────────────▶ CANCELLED
    └──45m timeout / eod────────────────────▶ EXPIRED (never_entered)
```

- Born as `SIG-YYYYMMDD-NNN` from an **A/A+ only** decision. B/C never alert
- **Only one signal alive at a time**
- The **live Entry Gate's CONFIRMED state is the entry trigger**, so the
  lifecycle cannot drift from what actually fired
- **Never-entered signals are stored** — they tell you whether the
  wait-patiently discipline is skipping losers (good) or missing winners (bad)

```

**One figure, not three.** Streamlit columns give three independent Plotly
figures, and Plotly can only synchronise axes *within* a figure. A single
figure with `rowspan` + `matches="x"` gives the proportions **and** real
synchronised zoom/pan/crosshair.

`matches="x"` not `shared_xaxes=True` — the latter only links within a column,
and NIFTY is in a different column from the legs.

Other decisions, each preventing a named failure:

| Mechanism | Prevents |
|---|---|
| `today_slice()` | Previous-day bars squeezing today into a sliver |
| `master_timeline()` + `align()` | A leg's untraded minute sliding later candles left |
| `uirevision` keyed on zoom | Streamlit's rerun resetting the trader's zoom |
| `hoversubplots="axis"` in try/except | Old Plotly raising; degrades to per-panel hover |
| Manual per-panel y-range | Zoom moving time and nothing else |
| Buttons, not scroll-wheel | The wheel zooming when you scroll the page past it |

**The dashboard creates nothing.** Two places refuse to answer:

1. **Premium entry/stop** — the Decision Engine works in NIFTY points;
   conversion needs delta, which no engine produces. *"A delta-free conversion
   would put a confident ₹ figure on the screen that no engine stands behind."*
2. **Per-leg strength without a leg-bias row** — reported absent, not 50%

Tint requires a **≥10-point strength gap** — tinting on 51/49 reads as a signal
where there is none.

### The three-key-shape trap

The app writes per-leg caches under three different key shapes:

```
_atm_leg_dfs         → "ATM CE 24250"   (with the ATM offset prefix)
_atm_leg_vob_volume  → "CE 24250"       (leg_name, no prefix)
every store, also    → "sid_65806"
```

`_leg_store()` tries all three. Before that fix, VOB and Money Flow read "—"
on every cycle regardless of the market.

# Part 10 — Alerts

## 10.1 · Two gates before anything sends

```python
_msg_allowed(message)      # is this headline on the allow-list at all?
_msg_entry_tier(message)   # does it qualify for the MAIN Telegram bot?
```

## 10.2 · The Telegram tier

**Only six markers reach the main Telegram bot:**

```
FRESH ENTRY · ENTRY GATE · EXIT GATE ·
ZONE REVERSAL · REVERSAL WARNING · STAY PATIENT
```

Everything else is **Discord + Supabase only**.

## 10.3 · `RETIRE_ENTRY_ALERTS = True`

MIOS V5 is pure decision-support (locked decision #1). These classes are
suppressed **at the send layer**:

```
leg_entry · confirmed_entry · entry_result · all_aligned_entry ·
sr_confluence · fresh_entry · bias_enter ·
spot_sh_aligned · cie_aligned · sr_touch_aligned
```

The confirmed-entry **lifecycle still runs** — only the message is withheld —
so Stage 40 keeps its validation data.

## 10.4 · Channels

| Channel | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Main Telegram bot | The six entry-tier markers only |
| Alert Telegram bot | Separate high-conviction stream |
| Discord webhook | Everything on the allow-list |
| Discord bot (REST) | Direct channel post |
| `discord_bot.py` | Separate process, `!commands` |

⚠️ `MIOS_BRIEFINGS = False` — the Evolution-shift briefing channel is opt-in
and OFF by default.

## 10.5 · Throttling

`_throttled_telegram_send(msg, alert_class, key, cooldown_s=900)` — per-class,
per-key cooldowns, typically 600–1800s. Every send is logged via
`_log_sent_alert` for audit.

---

# Part 11 — Persistence

## 11.1 · Key tables

| Migration | Table | Holds |
|---|---|---|
| 005 | `alert_log` | every alert sent |
| 008 | `signal_outcomes` | Stage 40 validation |
| 009 | `engine_errors` | structured engine failures |
| 012/013 | `entry_gate_signals` / `_exits` | live gate history |
| 016/017 | `market_events` / `market_stories` | Stage 28/36 |
| 018 | `engine_state` | replay source |
| 022 | `vob_app_state` | **the mobile-view snapshot** |
| 023 | `opening_auction_log` | first-30-min behaviour |
| 024 | `event_impact_log` | Stage 33 peak per event/day |
| 025 | `mios_decisions` | **Decision v0 — every transition + rejection** |
| 026 | `trade_signals` | the Signal Lifecycle |
| 027 | `learning.sql` | **five append-only tables** (Stages 55–60) |
| 028/029/030 | `day_type_log` · `session_log` · `session_validation` | Stages 68/69/70 |

## 11.2 · Append-only ⚠️ BINDING

`sql/027_learning.sql` is **append-only**. Nothing is ever updated, so replay
and backtesting show **what was known at the time**.

## 11.3 · State publish

- `_publish_app_state()` (`vob_minimal`) — throttled to once per 60s, snapshots
  the `_PERSIST_KEYS` session state holds and upserts one row to
  `vob_app_state` via `SupabaseDB.save_app_state`. `mios_v5/app_state.py` owns
  the JSON-safety and the cadence; the writer owns the row.
- **The one consumer is `discord_bot.py`** — a separate process that cannot see
  `session_state`, answering `!picture` / `!bias` / `!news` out of
  `_market_picture`, `_leg_bias_summary` and `_news_bias`.

⚠️ There is **no restore**. The row is published for another process to read,
not read back on startup — re-seeding a restarted session with old alert-dedup
and latch state would resurrect decisions the app had already made.

⚠️ For most of this app's life there was **no writer at all**: `_PERSIST_KEYS`,
`sql/022` and the bot's `load_payload()` all existed and nothing joined them,
so every `!picture` answered *"not available yet — is the app running?"* while
the app was running. `test_app_state_bridge.py` runs the real producer keys
through the real writer into the real bot functions and is what keeps that from
recurring.

# Part 12 — The laws

From `docs/ARCHITECTURE_PRINCIPLES.md` — *"Binding. These outrank convenience,
and they outrank 'helpful' refactors."*

| # | Principle |
|---|---|
| 1 | **Single source of truth** — every market fact has exactly one owner |
| 2 | **Never recalculate** — `calculate_cvd_v6()` etc. must never exist |
| 3 | **One calculation → many consumers** — publish once, read many |
| 4 | **No hidden logic** — engines receive inputs as **parameters**, never reach into `session_state` |
| 5 | **Engines never own indicators** — Indicator → Engine ✅, Engine → Indicator ❌ |
| 6 | **Preserve the observational rule** — no refactor changes Entry, Guardian, Decision, Alerts or Confidence |
| 7 | **Backward compatibility** — every dashboard, message, API and alert keeps working |
| 8 | **Publish everything once** — one `OrderFlowSnapshot` |
| 9 | **Fail fast** — an unmeasured fact is `MISSING`, never `0` |
| 10 | **Performance** — a refactor must *reduce* calculations. Measure before and after |
| 11 | **Deliver the audit** — every consolidation ships with a before/after count |
| 12 | **Every computed decision must be inspectable** — if an engine influences a score, recommendation, timing, risk, trail or execution state, the trader must see the engine, its inputs and its output. **Hidden influence is prohibited** |
| 13 | **Non-negotiable** — *"A year from now there must still be exactly one implementation of every piece of market logic."* |

## 12.1 · What the tests actually enforce

| Test | Fails the build on |
|---|---|
| `test_no_duplicate_order_flow_engine_exists` | any `def <indicator>_v6(` |
| `test_no_hand_written_buy_fraction_survives` | an inline buy-fraction formula in `vob_minimal.py` |
| `test_explainability_exposes_no_mutators` | `decide`/`apply`/`set_confidence`/`set_weight` on Stages 61–67 |
| `test_learning_modules_expose_no_mutators` | `apply`/`deploy`/`promote` on Stages 55–60 |
| `test_stage_70_exposes_no_mutators` | **AST walk** — any assignment to `SESSION_AWARE` from Stage 70 |
| `test_every_output_declares_itself_advisory` | a missing `advisory_only: True` |
| `test_every_producer_has_exactly_one_home` | a producer in two horizon categories |
| `test_every_engine_is_registered` | **a new engine with no declared horizon** |
| `test_every_native_label_still_exists` | a `_BIAS_CATEGORY` rename orphaning an owner |
| `test_no_aggregate_may_own_a_horizon` | a composite voting and re-counting its members |
| `test_swing_never_returns_a_side` | swing emitting a CALL/PUT |
| `test_no_panel_still_uses_a_retired_grey` | a panel below the contrast floor |

## 12.2 · Principle 12, and the bug that produced it

Stage 37 Market Energy was shaping the Opportunity Matrix's lifetime estimate
and feeding its risk drivers on **every cycle**, while the panel cell labelled
"Energy" showed the *rotation* read instead. A third thing — the bull/bear vote
bar — was also called Energy. The engine was acting on the screen and absent
from it.

Nothing was miscomputed. The trader simply could not see what was moving the
answer, which is the whole failure: **an engine you cannot see is an engine you
cannot distrust at the moment it is wrong.**

Two corollaries, because they are where this gets violated:

* **A modifier is an influence.** Multiplying a confidence by 0.8 is as much a
  decision as producing a bias, and the ×0.8 needs a visible owner.
* **Consumed-but-unpublished is the smell.** If a value is read inside a
  computation and appears in no panel, either surface it or stop reading it.

Applies to Stage 44's veto, 47/54's stability modifiers, Stage 69's session
modifiers, Stage 71's scoring, and everything after.

## 12.3 · The honest limit

> The guard tests catch the *named* failure modes. They cannot catch someone
> reimplementing CVD inline under a different variable name inside a render
> block. **That is exactly how the six copies arose in the first place.**
>
> The durable defence is principle 3: if a number is worth computing, publish
> it, and the next person will find it rather than rewrite it.

# Part 13 — Operating the app

## 13.1 · Running

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run vob_minimal.py
```

Secrets go in `.streamlit/secrets.toml` (gitignored):

```toml
DHAN_CLIENT_ID = "..."
DHAN_ACCESS_TOKEN = "..."
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN = "..."
TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID  = "..."
DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL = "..."
[supabase]
url = "..."
anon_key = "..."
```

Run every migration in `sql/` against your Supabase project, in numeric order.

## 13.2 · The three view modes

| Mode | How | What runs |
|---|---|---|
| **Full** | default | everything |
| **Lite** | sidebar radio | curated 6-block stack. **Compute, alerts and DB writes are identical** — only display changes |
| ~~**Mobile**~~ | ~~`?view=mobile`~~ | **gone** — no query-param handling remains in `vob_minimal.py` |

The mobile page was removed. `vob_app_state` is still written (§11.3), but its
only reader today is the standalone `discord_bot.py`.

## 13.3 · Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| Spot frozen, panels live | An engine reading last cycle's cache | Publish the cache before step 18 (§4.3) |
| Trade Card blank | A fragment raised; `except: pass` swallowed it | Temporarily remove the wrapper at `vob_minimal.py:18294` |
| "⏸️ Dhan rate-limited (DH-904)" | 429 back-off active | Wait 90s; cached data is being served |
| "🔑 Dhan token expired" | 401 | Sidebar → Refresh Dhan Token |
| VOB / Money Flow show "—" | Leg key-shape mismatch | Check `_leg_key_variants` covers your store |
| S/R panel "still warming up" forever | It is an **error**, not a warm-up | Read `_sr_status` — it names build failure vs cold start |
| Alert not arriving on Telegram | Not in `_TELEGRAM_ENTRY_MARKERS` | By design — check Discord |
| Engine silently NEUTRAL | Missing upstream | Check Stage 0 health panel + `engine_errors` |

## 13.4 · Tests

```bash
python3 -m pytest mios_v5/tests/ -q
```

Expect **1,608 tests, all passing**. Part 15 records what is still open.

## 13.5 · Adding an engine — the checklist

1. Answer the **admission rule** (§7.2). Wave 3 is frozen
2. Subclass `Engine`, return `EngineResult`, declare `deps`
3. Take inputs as **parameters** (principle 4)
4. Register in `mios_v5/engines/__init__.py::ALL_ENGINES`
5. Expose it on `final_read` if any V6 module needs it
6. Ship it **observational** with `advisory_only: True`
7. Write the guard test that keeps it observational
8. Log it. Promotion needs 2–4 weeks of live data **and a human**

# Part 15 — Known issues

*As of this document's commit. Verify with `pytest` before trusting.*

## 15.1 · The suite is green

**1,608 passing, 0 failing.**

Three tests failed for most of this project's recent history, and all three
traced to a single revert rather than three bugs. Commit `9a79542` gave
`indicators/order_flow.py` sole ownership of the CLV buy/sell split and
removed six inline copies; four `Add files via upload` commits landed on top,
and the last of them put the copies back and deleted 70 lines from
`dashboard_v6.py`.

Restored in `3dbf592` — `9a79542`'s patch still applied cleanly with `--3way`.
The guard tests did exactly the job they were written for, and they were right
for weeks before anyone acted on them. **A red suite that everyone has learned
to ignore is worse than no suite**; treat these three as the reason the rules
in Part 12 are enforced by tests rather than documented.

## 15.2 · Hardcoded Discord webhook

A live webhook URL is committed at `vob_minimal.py:178`, `:181` and `:195` as
the no-secrets fallback. Anyone with repo access can post to that channel.
**Rotate it and replace the fallback with `""`.**

## 15.3 · Smaller items

| Item | Location |
|---|---|
| Bare `except:` swallows `KeyboardInterrupt`/`SystemExit` | `vob_minimal.py:169` |
| Two different "held N min" (Stage 68 session vs Stage 54 state) read as one number contradicting itself | Trade Card |
| `🌙 Market Closed` can render beside a live behaviour label | `session_strip` |
| Trade Card `except: pass` hides all render errors | `vob_minimal.py:18294` |
| V6 divergence sentence can name the wrong voter | `v6_bias.py:324` |
| Stage 46 (Market Control) never built | Wave 4 |
| No T1/T2/T3 target ladder — Stage 35 produces one `next_target` | a ladder is new computation, not a rendering |
| Stage 71.5 type and maturity are **global**, not per-horizon | by design — a confirmed breakdown is a market fact |
| Stage 71 pools are uneven (scalp 22, swing 5) | intended; Wilson handles it, but thin horizons still swing |

---

## Appendix — the one-paragraph summary

A Streamlit app polls Dhan every 20 seconds for NIFTY candles, the option chain
and ATM±3 option legs, publishes them into `session_state`, and then runs
**47 engines** over that snapshot. The **native layer** (Generation 1) produces
the Market Picture and the Entry Gate, and is the only thing that fires an
alert. **MIOS V5** (stages 0–41) arbitrates ~34 engines through the Conflict
Engine into the headline bias. **MIOS V6** (stages 37, 42–54, 68–69) re-derives
that bias from four de-duplicated voters and displays it beside V5 — never
instead of it. Two **Decision Engines** (v0 and v2) grade the setup and log
every verdict including rejections. Everything past Generation 1 is
observational, carries `advisory_only: True`, and is barred by tests from ever
touching a live decision until weeks of logged evidence and *a human flipping a
constant* promote it.
